00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Good morning Hank it’s Tuesday

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.440
So I love visual art;
I think it is so good and helpful&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.400
to have stuff on your walls
that connects you to beauty and wonder&nbsp;

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.520
and awe, but one thing about art
is that it is often very expensive,&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.880
and another thing about art is that
the art world can be, kind of, uh,&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.440
gross;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.560
You know,, headlines like
Paul Allen’s art collection to be auctioned&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.280
for a billion Dollars does not
make one feel as if art is for&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.520
normal people but it is I promise it is.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.280
So first off, art does not have to be expensive.
Like one of my favorite artworks in our home&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.720
is this print by Nathaniel Russell
demanding snake poems now,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.360
I love it because it’s beautiful
and also because posters tend to&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.080
make political statements or encourage
consumption habits,&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.400
and this poster just wants snake poetry,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.600
And I like to imagine rallies
for snake poetry where people are like&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.680
What do we want?
Snake Poems!&nbsp;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.520
When do we want them?
Hisssssss

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.960
But anyway, Russell’s prints are available
on his web site for $40,&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120
and there are similarly talented artists
all over the world who have work available;&nbsp;

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840
many even take commissions
via instagram or Twitter.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
And if you want to get really inexpensive art,
you can go to like thrift stores and garage sales&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.240
and often find unique works there,
and you can always make a good&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.040
thrift store painting great by adding
your own star wars,&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.800
like Dave of daveruinsart.com does–
by the way his prints are $20.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880
Also, you might think art auctions
are only for the rich people,&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.640
but there are art auctions on eBay
all the time, and also Artsy.net,&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.320
where for example right now there
is one fundraiser auction with&nbsp;

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280
an artwork by Michelle Grabner,
one of my favorite artists,&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.240
for $300, which is a lot of money,&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
but also if you have it for 50 years
it’s less than 2 cents a day.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.920
Now I know what you’re thinking,
John, you just turned 45.&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.720
You’re not gonna look at anything every
Day for the next 50 years.&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.520
Thank you. Thank you for bringing
that energy into the video.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.760
Back to art!
For me Artsy is kind of like Zillow&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760
for art; it’s a great place just to like, scroll&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.040
through and and what you like
And what things cost&nbsp;

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.440
and what galleries or artists
you might want to follow.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.560
Now there are two big auction houses ar
Sotheby’s and Christie’s, and they make&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.080
almost all of their money selling, like,
Rolexes and Warhols to the world’s&nbsp;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.880
richest people, but anybody can
visit their websites.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.080
And I like to look at them, partly&nbsp;

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.920
so that I can think to myself,
“Wow, someone is really going to spend&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.760
$100,000,000 on this painting by
Claude Monet and then store in a&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.040
windowless storage facility
wealth is a hell of a drug.”&nbsp;

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
But also, not everything is Monet-expensive.
Like, one of my favorite impressionist painters,&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.640
Eugene Boudin, who was one of
Monet’s teachers, and whose works&nbsp;

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.760
on paper sometimes sell for like a couple
thousand dollars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.280
which is a ton of money obviously
but it’s 1/100,000th the cost of a Monet.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440
Plus, it’s just fun to look at the art&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.240
and if you zoom in on the paintings
and make them full resolution,&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.080
it costs Sotheby’s and Christie’s a
little bit of hosting money,&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.827
which they pass on to the people
who buy stuff, so… you know …&nbsp;

00:02:30.827 --> 00:02:34.080
is like a very indirect tax on the
world’s richest people, the rich.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.040
Okay, and then of course,&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.560
there are art galleries and local art centers
and art schools, where works are often for sale.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.040
Also there are art fairs, where you can see
A curated selection of lots of art.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.920
Like, this weekend in Indianapolis is Butter,&nbsp;

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.320
an annual art fair featuring Black artists
from Indianapolis and around the world;

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.960
There are also DJ’s and artist workshops
And lots of other stuff.&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.640
It is overwhelmingly the coolest thing
that happens in Indianapolis and I’m not just&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.200
Saying that because Sarah is part of the
curatorial team.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.880
So, if you live in Indianapolis, there’s Butter;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.840
but wherever you live,
there is so much cool art!&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.720
For me, the art that means the most to me
Is the stuff that I connect to personally.&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.640
Maybe that’s because I see a painting
that looks the way OCD feels to me.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.240
Or maybe it’s art made by someone I love.&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.880
Like my favorite work of art in our home
is this painting that my mom made&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.840
of the lazy boy where I wrote
Looking for Alaska.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.880
It brings me such joy and solace–
and I hope that you’ve got art&nbsp;

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.640
that does the same for you.
Hank, I’ll see you on Friday.
