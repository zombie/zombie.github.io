00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.460
What do Steve Jobs, Tony Stark, Bill Gates,
and Elon Musk all have in common?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.340
They're all fictional characters.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.720
Thank you very much. Good morning!

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.410
When I first became governor of Judea eight
years ago, I recognised that we needed a totally

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:45.460
new long-term, sustainable approach to innovate the
Roman Empire. Our mission as Romans is to

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:55.360
to invent, design, and inspire the new way of doing things and set people free from the old ways.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.410
What I love about working for the Roman Empire
is that our team is changing the world.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.909
It's awesome to go to work with some of finest
minds who are committed to building a totally

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:18.180
new way of doing almost everything. From politics, to leisure, to taxes, to defence...

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.080
The Roman Empire is the network of tomorrow.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:36.619
So when I saw the headlines about my decision
to execute Jesus of Nazareth I had just one

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:45.779
overriding thought: "How can I better demonstrate
the incredible value that I know the Roman Empire

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.720
can deliver?" Because the value of Rome is more than
just order and peace. Much more than that.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.359
It's job opportunities. Infrastructure.
Civil engineering. Security. All these features

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:10.810
combine to make the Roman Empire the
most revolutionary network ever designed

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.860
with the power to change ordinary people's
lives for the better. So I have nothing personal

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.120
against God but He is a little obsolete.
Thank you very much.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.300
Partie numehau deux - Ceci n'est pas un
Elon Musk

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.650
Elon Reeve Musk was born in South Africa in
1971. Having previously owned a slice of PayPal,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.100
and now as the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX,
as well as having fingers in many other pies,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.570
Musk is the 53rd richest person in the world,
with a net worth of about twenty billion US dollars.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.980
Pontius Pilate was a real historical figure,
who did actually live at the time Jesus is supposed

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.730
to have been crucified, and served as Prefect
of Judea from AD 26 to AD 36. Both he and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.580
his wife, Claudia, have at one time or another
been venerated as Saints by various Orthodox

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.160
churches, though his role in the fictionalised Bible story is usually to represent someone who seeks

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.690
to avoid responsibility for the death of Jesus through the symbolic washing of his hands

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.240
before giving the death sentence.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.460
Elon Musk enjoys something of a cult status.
Many people see him as kind of a hero, or

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.890
at least an inspiration, and I could talk about his tweets al day or about his personal life but

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.400
hey, I'm less curious about Elon Musk the man - Some More News already made that video and it's really good so you can go and watch him

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.590
I'm more curious about Elon Musk the myth

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:06.030
- the symbol of the type, the technological
industrial wizard, the Tony Stark/Nicola Tesla

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.510
figure of the scientist/industrialist
who breaks with the established way of doing

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.820
things and creates something new. And personally although I do love the term Tech Daddy, there is

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.651
another term from the 60s for men, and it is often
men, who are mythologised in this way - the

00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:31.450
"Comprehensive Designer." Someone who
is a "synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.850
objective economist and evolutionary strategist."

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.610
Funnily enough, how we today think about computers
and technology and Comprehensive Designers

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.790
like Elon Musk owes a huge debt to 60s
counterculture. In his book "From Counterculture

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.410
to Cyberculture," communications Professor
Fred Turner explains that there were really two

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.460
strands to the counterculture of the 1960s. On the one hand you had the Radical Left Wing, who were doing things like registering

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.680
new voters, protesting the Vietnam War, starting new political parties and organisations, bringing challenges  to expand civil rights...

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.520
And then there were the New Communalists,
who built communes, LSD, free love, rock and roll,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.660
anti-authoritarianism, flower power, peace signs -
the people you probably think of when you

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.794
hear "60s counterculture." And really these two strands weren't

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:31.850
all that separate: plenty of hippies protested the Vietnam War and plenty of young radicals did LSD but those were two

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.370
trends, the second of which, the New Communalists,
came to be seen in time as cool, which is why we

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.290
associate their aesthetic with that particular period of history.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.669
A lot of those who were on the New Communalist hippie scene later got interested in technology

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.730
and mingled with the new generation who were building early computers and

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.510
the web, and gradually people came to see
computers not as symbols of stuffy corporate

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.389
authority but as the digital frontier that would set people free!

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.490
Funnily enough since we're talking about
Elon Musk, for a brief window in the mid-70s

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.530
space colonies became a countercultural fascination.
The idea of escaping the strictures of what

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:21.100
was known to a new space was just like building
a commune, only in space.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.440
The New Communalists took their values and ideas to teams that built early computers

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.820
and the web and gradually the idea of the commune - the
new space that represents rebellion against

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:42.560
the old order - morphed from rural commune to
space commune to digital commune: cyberspace.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.630
This cool new place that's beyond the reach of any
one government or authority.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.340
And so by the 90s, engineers, hackers, and software developers had come to be seen as the new

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.979
countercultural heroes, the Comprehensive Designers,
Masters of the new frontier who were gonna

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.320
network the globe and tear down all the old systems man!

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.449
So that's where the figure of Comprehensive Designer/ Tech Daddy comes from. Now, a Backlash, named

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.000
by author Susan Faludi in her book of the
same name, is a period of history where instead

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.700
of progress in the fields of rights and equality, the opposite happens. Things get worse, rights get rolled back,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.760
as those whose privilege is challenged by progress fight to defend

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.590
that unearned privilege. So Faludi talks a lot
about the Reagan Era as a period of Backlash

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.229
for women's rights, lot of stuff got rolled back. Arguably we're living through another Backlash right now.

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:03.699
And the seeds of today's Backlash were already
lying dormant in 60s counterculture. Although

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:08.650
the New Communalists were going
for an egalitarian vibe a lot of communes

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:14.440
tended to be populated by overwhelmingly white, relatively wealthy, educated young people.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.240
Although they were trying to break away from traditional ways of doing things they often reproduced traditional gender roles on the communes;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.080
Some of them ended up marginalising women.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:28.500
And although they were aiming at independence from the system a lot of them received bankrolling from outside

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.420
or were set up in places that actually made life more difficult for the poorer folks who lived nearby.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:40.260
"And then what America does, while these people are talking, it very, very gradually

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.300
builds a Starbucks around them. And then -

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.920
They all become addicted to latte and they lose the will to rebel!

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.330
They still definitely had their achievements, but just
there were some drawbacks as well. And those

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.390
drawbacks continued into 90s digital counterculture.
Wired magazine wrote a lot about how technology,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.540
and the Comprehensive Designers who were mastering
it and were gonna tear down all the old hierarchies.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.020
But although Wired presented itself as openly countercultural its audience

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:15.850
were also overwhelmingly white, male, and
very wealthy, the very people whose material

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.600
interests lay in not changing the world too much.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.870
Indeed, Wired was an openly libertarian magazine,
praising right-wing conservative figures like

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.260
Newt Gingrich and George Gilder, both of whom
appeared on the cover. They were all about

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:35.440
deregulating the net, man, setting information free! Unfortunately, despite their noble intentions, they sleepwalked right

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.500
into legitimising the deregulation of industry more widely, the cutting of welfare, and the massive inequality we have today.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.140
Like the New Communalists of the 60s, the techno-libertarians of the late 80s/early 90s liked to think of themselves as being independent

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:57.320
from the system and creating something new, but they weren't really. They were still entangled within it. A lot of the physical labour of actually assembling

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.270
computers was done by undocumented
immigrants, women, and people of colour who didn't

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:07.630
really get a slice of the shiny techno-utopia that was promised on the box. Nowadays a lot of those

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:14.940
dangerous, difficult jobs are done by  workers in state capitalist China, where Elon Musk has just been trying to build his

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.740
own factory, incidentally. Similarly, part of the Tech Daddy myth today is that he's a visionary who stands apart

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.680
from the system and doesn't need anyone
else: he's "Self-Made." And this is false

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.640
for some interesting economic reasons we'll get to shortly, but also on a surface level

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:35.320
it's kindof easy to see through because the technologies that Comprehensive Designers bring to market aren't always the

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:42.640
result of divine or even privately funded inspiration: like the iPhone is an aggregate of a bunch of technologies

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.790
that had already been invented through public funding. An impressive invention, absolutely no doubt, but not

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:56.840
exactly Promethean. A lot of "self-made" successful
people, including Elon Musk, had very wealthy parents

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.510
already. So Comprehensive Designers as we know them today are kindof like fictional characters. The

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.290
myth doesn't match the men.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:14.350
They are fictional characters with a purpose
though. And in order to understand that purpose,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:21.000
and where counterculture is today, we re gonna need to talk about Slavoj Žižek and flirting.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.101
Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek coined
the useful term 'Liberal Communists.' And if

00:11:27.101 --> 00:11:31.550
you know any political philosophy you'll already
have spotted that this is a contradictory

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:37.089
term, it's like saying 'Square Circle.' A
Liberal, with a Capital L, is someone who maybe

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:43.240
has maybe some progressive social ideas but still thinks that capitalism is okay. Whereas Communists

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.029
are a subgroup of Leftists: the sexy, talented people who realise that capitalism is rubbish and it needs to go.

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:54.800
So surely you can't be a Liberal and a Communist? You can't both support

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.130
and seek to destroy capitalism?

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:04.240
Žižek knows this and made the term deliberately
contradictory in order to highlight a particular contradiction

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.550
in our society, and for my money that contradiction is best expressed

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:16.370
through flirting. Specifically the kind of flirting that consenting people do when they haven't gotten

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:27.490
together yet, but they want to. And the whole game of flirting is saying something that is suggestive

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.200
but not putting all your cards on the table
and declaring outright that you fancy the

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.090
person, because if you go in there all guns blazing you might end up getting rejected. So you've gotta

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.490
maintain a little bit of deniability, not in a creepy "I never said that inappropriate thing"-way,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:47.140
but just in an ego-protecting way, so the
other person starts to think, "Oh, do they fancy

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:53.340
me? Are they flirting with me? How do I feel about that? I kinda want them to fancy me, maybe I'll say something

00:12:53.340 --> 00:13:00.320
a little bit suggestive back and we'll see how it goes down." And that's the brinkmanship, that's the fun, that's the game:

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.440
who's gonna break cover first and make an unambiguous move? Who wants it more?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.970
And of course the other person (or people)
probably know that you're doing this, you all

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.540
know the game, but it just adds a layer
of fun.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.820
So the whole practice of flirting only

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:27.280
works insofar as you can plausibly disavow that what you're saying reflects what you're thinking.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:36.120
And what Žižek says is that so much stuff
relies on exactly the same kind of disavowal.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:45.720
Like wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, for instance. Wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt that's been mass produced is on some level kinda perverse.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.480
Some poor exploited person probably had to make that T-shirt in a faraway country in terrible conditions

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:59.580
for pennies an hour, and that whole system goes against everything the man whose face is on the shirt fought and died for.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:06.800
But if I wear it ironically, then I can do
it, because I know that it's bad. I disavow it.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.160
I'm innocent.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.280
I'm innocent...

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.280
I am innocent.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
I am innocent of this man's blood.
I AM INNOCENT OF THIS MAN'S BLOOD!

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.180
CRUCIFY HIM!

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.460
I wash my hands of this!

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:32.560
And the key point is that like flirting my wearing the Che Guevara T-shirt actually depends on me disavowing

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:41.380
it. Pontius Pilate can't sentence Jesus to death until he's washed his hands first. The disavowal is central to the  whole operation.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:47.830
But I still wear the shirt. Particularly
under capitalism we focus a lot on people's intentions:

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:53.480
I wear the Che Guevara T-shirt but I'm not a bad person because I didn't intend anything bad by it, I know that it's bad,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:01.550
unlike some imaginary person who wears it because they like the pattern I guess - Elon Musk might not get things right all the time but at least his intentions are good! And Žižek

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:07.790
says it ain't about what you intend to do, it's not about what you believe in your heart or whether

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:13.660
you're a good person, it's about the material effect your actions have on the world.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:20.680
So forget the flirting and just tell me straight up: are we gonna leave it?

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.240
Or are we gonna get in that bedroom and

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.040
So Liberal Communists are bigtime capitalists: millionaires, billionaires, business owners,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:38.620
who simultaneously wash their hands of capitalism
through their actions. Like Bill Gates, former

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.360
hacker, huge countercultural icon
in his day, huge business owner now,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.950
but gives millions away to charity: a fundamentally
anticapitalist move because you're giving

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:54.600
money away rather than investing it expecting
returns. Ma boy Elon - Cave Daddy Maximum,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:02.010
MC Tesla - gives free batteries to Puerto Rico. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, gives millions to medical research at Princeton.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.340
And of course, George Soros. How could we forget Georgie?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:12.240
I could even name some millionaire Liberal Communists on the YouTube scene; if it weren't for the off chance they'd be watching.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:20.920
Now don't get me wrong: charity, grants, batteries, those can be amazing. Change lives. Save lives! But in order

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.730
to give wealth you first have to take wealth,
or as some would put it, "create" wealth.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:33.700
And here we're getting into the deep economic reasons that explode the Tech Daddy myth - profit

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.780
is generated by the workers. If you're a
capitalist, you can throw as much money as

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.820
you want at a block of wood it will not
turn into a chair.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:48.100
INVESTMENT! INVESTMENT! INVESTMENT!

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.040
You can throw as much money as you like at
a sheet of metal, it will not turn into a

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.940
Tesla. It only turns into something you can sell
for profit because somebody puts in the time

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.740
and works on it, and in order to make that
profit you mathematically have to pay that

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:09.069
person less than the value they added to the starting materials. That's true of people who work in factories

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:13.209
it's true of people who build the robots that replace people who work in factories workers, it's

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:18.110
true of YouTubers, it's true of people who pull pints in the pub and people who work in the HR departments

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:24.550
of massive corporations. You are always being
paid less than the true monetary value of your

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:30.480
work, and the only way to get the full amount
is if instead of the boss owning the factory

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:37.960
and everything that gets made in it, the workers between them cut out the middle man and own it together. Which is what we call socialism.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.040
But under capitalism, every penny of a billionaire's fortune is a penny of  unpaid work that someone else did.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.980
In addition, and this is a big deal whether you're a Marxist or you're not cool, Liberal Communists

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:55.090
have every incentive to protect their wealth
and the means by which they acquire it, and

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.700
that means getting involved in politics, and
they do. It's common knowledge now that

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.350
ol' Elon gives millions to both of America's political parties: and although they aren't

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.240
both exactly the same, they do both support
capitalism. He also discourages his

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.340
Maybe that's slightly unfair. Or at least potentially legally dodgy...

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.800
Elon?

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:27.580
Elon mate. Is it - y'alright? -  is it fair to say that you discourage your employees from unionising?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.480
Well you don't encourage it? Okay, that's
fair.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.700
There are some sneakier tactics too: most
every billionaire will have a charitable foundation

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.410
named after them, like the Gates Foundation,
and some of the money from those goes to political

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.360
think tanks who advise governments.
And they ain't the political think tanks

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.830
recommending we abolish billionaires. That
is a little bit more like an investment only

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.220
the product is your engineered political consent.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.720
And here's the real kicker from Mark Fisher,
"Far from constituting any kind of progressive

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.870
alternative to official capitalist ideology,
liberal communism constitutes the dominant

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:16.980
ideology of capitalism now." The legacy
of 60s counterculture into 90s digital

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:23.530
counterculture is that an opportunity for genuine transformation wasn't quite followed through all the way,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:31.059
but the aesthetics of counterculture, of the Comprehensive Designer and the tech rebel, became very fashionable.

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:38.240
Nowadays capitalism sells us symbols of anti-capitalist
resistance because as long as we're consuming

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.470
those symbols - wearing the Che Guevara
T-shirt, watching the movie where the bad guy

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.210
is an evil corporation, praising wealth hoarders for their generosity or people who got

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.370
where they are because of their workers as
visionaries who did it alone - as long as

00:19:50.370 --> 00:20:01.480
evolution is sold as revolution, the actual revolution - the substantive break with everything that has come before - is delayed. That doesn't mean that

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.380
all of those movies and artworks and even Teslas aren't great fun,

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.710
Ya like jazz?

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:13.860
but it does mean that the Tech Daddy isn't a figure of counterculture; it's an advertising mascot for backlash.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.220
"Why are you cheering, Fry? You're not rich!"

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.620
"True. But someday I might be rich. And then people like me better watch their step!"

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:35.299
As a final thought, the character of the Tech Daddy is used to sell Backlash to men, but similar tactics

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:40.460
are being employed to sell it to people of other genders too. Today's counterculture includes

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.180
trans-inclusive tendencies, feminist tendencies,  the widespread acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:53.800
and we're already seeing those features
of it being used to wallpaper media aimed at women

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.730
that's really just about getting advertising
clicks. There are corporations who have floats

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:06.960
in the London Pride Parade who sell weapons to countries that use those weapons on LGBT people.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.280
Counterculture will have the anticapitalist strains removed, and what's left will be used to sell you shit.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.830
Just a couple days ago I was at Summer in
the City, a big YouTube convention here in the

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:25.150
UK, and I was on a panel and I brought up the fact that the cameras and laptops we YouTubers use to do our jobs, contain

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:31.059
within them Coltan. Coltan is a conflict
mineral. The extraction of coltan in the Democratic

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.840
Republic of Confo is doing massive social, economic, and environmental damage.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.520
And that's not even getting into to the poor buggers out in China who are gonna be assembling all tis electronics

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.140
in factory dormitories in absolutely terrible conditions being horribly exploited

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.520
building the same machine that I will actually use to edit this video.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.720
And when I brought this up I was quite shocked: there was another YouTuber on the panel

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.500
who by all accounts is very progressive and very lovely who completely vehemently dismissed

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.270
these concerns. Who said, "I'm here to speak for my audience!" and I said, "Okay cool:

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:12.560
I wonder who's gonna speak up for all the people who do the actual material work that puts us on this stage though?" And he just went, "Not me!"

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:19.820
Which is less, "I wash my hands of this," and more, "Ah, a little BLOOD never hurt anybody!" Abblllblabblllblbbll...

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:30.990
And here's my big question that I genuinely ask myself quite a lot - is this same process of counterculture into backlash happening to us?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:38.250
To YouTube? To Leftist YouTube in particular? As our channels get bigger, as we start employing people like research

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.640
assistants and musicians and we start selling T-shirts, getting invited to industry

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:50.460
parties and movie premiers... Are we gonna end up just emptily disavowing and washing our hands of it all?

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:58.200
Are we gonna wake up one day ad look in the mirror and not recognise who's looking back at us because instead of our face

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.160
it's just the pallid, shrimp-eyed face...

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.160
of Elon Reeve Musk?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.920
Well did you hear, there's a natural order?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.300
Those most deserved will end up with the most.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.280
That the cream cannot help but always rise
up to the top?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.560
Well I say: Shit floats.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.220
If you thought things had changed,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.540
Friend you'd better think again,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.820
Bluntly put in the fewest of words,

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:55.700
Musks are still running the world...
Musks are still running the world...

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:10.740
Now the working classes are obsolete,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.440
They are surplus to society's needs,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.780
So let 'em all kill each other,

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.130
And get it made overseas.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.030
That's the word, don'tcha know,

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:36.100
From the guys that's running the show,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.460
Let's be perfectly clear boys and girls,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:46.340
Oh, Musks are still running the world,

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.060
Munts are still running the world.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.620
Oh yeah!

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.020
Oh yeah!

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.520
Well feed your children on crayfish and Lobster tails,

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:11.670
Find a school near the top of the league,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:16.070
In theory I respect your right to exist,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:21.040
I will kill you if you move in next to me!

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:31.200
Oh it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically
unjust,

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:46.860
Oh but the takings are up by a third, Oh So Musks are still running the world! Yeah, Musks are still running the world!

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:56.440
Musks are still running the world! 
Musks are still running the world!

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.940
The free market is perfectly natural.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.700
Do you think that I'm some kind of dummy?

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:12.200
It's the ideal way to order the world,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.280
Fuck the morals, does it make any money?

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.200
And if you don't like it? Then leave.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.760
Or use your rights to protest on the street,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:32.600
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that
it's heard, Oh no no, cause

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:42.300
Musks are still running the world!
Musks are still running the world!

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:51.900
Musks are still running the world! Yeah,
Musks are still running the world!

00:26:51.900 --> 00:27:03.760
Oh, Musks are still running the world!
Yeah, Musks are still running the world!

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.560
MUSKS ARE

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.200
STILL RUNNIN'...

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.320
THE WOOOOOOOORRRRLLLLLLLLDDDD!

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.680
I'm gettin' absolutely eaten alive; I hate shooting outdoors.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.680
