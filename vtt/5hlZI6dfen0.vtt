00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.020
Hi.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.840
My name is Gabe and in this video, 
I'll be looking into The Social Network,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.820
my personal choice for the
best film of the last thirty years.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.900
I thought the response to this film was fascinating:

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.020
critics loved it, but unlike 
most films critics love, audiences liked it too.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.970
They didn't like it nearly as much as the
critics though, which begged the question:

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.050
what made this film so special?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.480
What do some people
see in it that others don't?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.700
First, a disclaimer.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960
Whenever I talk about this film,
I am specifically talking about the film,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.100
not its real-life counterparts.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.660
Mark Zuckerberg is Mark Zuckerberg 
the character, not the person.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.460
How accurate this film is to real life really
doesn't interest me, for reasons I'll get into later.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.900
Oh, and there'll be spoilers here as well.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.820
Alright, back to our video.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.750
In my opinion, what makes
The Social Network so special is simple: depth.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.380
What the film is really about.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.319
There are so many things going on in this
film, so many layers all working together,

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.160
it really is incredible.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.380
First, you have your base layers: the plot
is how Facebook was created,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.800
the characters are the creators,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.760
and the story is how the creation of Facebook
destroyed the relationships of its creators.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.300
How about now, you still wired in?

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.140
I think these aspects are what most audiences
enjoyed about the film.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.640
But to find out what is so special about The
Social Network, we have to go deeper,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.800
beyond plot and story
to what the film is actually about.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.480
And here, 
The Social Network is a treasure trove.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.520
So, what is The Social Network about?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.880
Is it about friendship?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.600
That's the story after all.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.720
Or betrayal, which is how the story is resolved?

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.060
Is it about entrepreneurship?

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
Ambition?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.680
The act of creation?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.940
Or maybe it's more specific.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.400
Is the film about old versus new?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.420
Old east coast versus
new west coast plays a big part in this film.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.720
Maybe the film is about
well-roundedness versus obsession?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.730
The Winklevii are well-rounded, 
as they so often love to remind us

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.360
Three hour low rate technical row 
before breakfast, full course load,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.110
studying, another three hours
in the tank, and then studying.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.640
while Mark is anything but.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.380
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the
airport an hour ago, I've been calling his cell.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.820
He was on a thirty-six hour coding tear
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.960
Maybe the film is about education versus instinct,
or what we've learned versus what we know?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.760
Everything Eduardo does is based on his education,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.900
I love working with business majors.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.900
Economics.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.340
while everything Mark does 
is based on what he somehow just knows.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.420
Adams has no security but limits
the number of results to twenty a page.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.000
All I need is to break out the
same script I used on Lowell and we're set.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.420
It's pretty amazing how much was 
packed into this film, how much it is about.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.900
Just check out these three moments:

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.460
Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.540
You have no idea what 
that's going to mean to my father.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.540
Sure I do.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.319
I'm being accused of animal cruelty;
it's better to be accused of necrophilia.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.920
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.200
I'll have to explain this to my father.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.940
I was your only friend, you had one friend.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.860
My father won't even look at me-

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.860
Okay, Eduardo

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.319
Minus the Winkleviis who hide behind their
dad, these are the only references to parents

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.510
in the entire film.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.500
But even so, the message is powerful,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.660
and it took less than
twenty seconds to add this dynamic to the film.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.940
The truth is, The Social Network
is about everything I just mentioned,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.160
but it is also about none of them.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.540
Because the next layer down,
the layer that is so rare for a film to execute on,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.660
is what the film is really about.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.680
Some people may call this the theme,
although I'm not a huge fan of that word,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.960
it's great for analysis but 
doesn't have much use in the creative process.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.480
Instead, I like to say it's the film's heart,
it is the singular idea where everything comes from:

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.880
plot, character, meaning, everything.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.220
It is where a film's power comes from,
it is what makes the film resonate,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.420
it gives the film everything and is what makes it great.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.940
So, what is Social Network really about?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.610
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.540
Simply put, it's about change.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.860
About changing the world, about changing yourself.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.940
More specifically, 
The Social Network is about how for some people

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.740
it is easier to change the world
than it is to change themselves.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.100
Every single aspect of
Social Network comes from this.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.420
For example, here are two of the most important
elements of any film: the first and last scenes.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.940
Just look at how different they are, 
the film starting dark and old-fashioned,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.080
filled with people talking face-to-face, then ending 
bright and modern, with Mark alone on his computer.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.220
The world has completely changed,
yet in both Mark is an outcast,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.720
failing to communicate and rejected by society.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.740
Mark may have changed the world, 
but he hasn't changed himself.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.440
Eduardo on the other hand, 
definitely changes, from a think-small schoolboy

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.520
to someone who has experienced how the world works.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.180
I mean, just look at the way he walks,
in the beginning, in the end.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.820
Also, look at what he's wearing, from a ridiculous
Hawaiian outfit to a good-looking high-end suit.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.880
Compare this to Mark, wearing F-you clothes
in the beginning, wearing F-you clothes in the end,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.760
You say: Sean Parker says fuck you.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.600
not caring how he walks in the beginning,
not caring how he walks in the end.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.660
It is also worth noting that unlike Mark,
Eduardo never is an outcast,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.940
he's accepted by the Fraternity in the beginning,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.800
I got punched by the Phoenix.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.520
and accepted by the audience in the end.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.500
Here's your nineteen thousand dollars.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.080
I wouldn't cash it though,
I drew it on the account you froze.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.620
I like standing next to you Sean,
makes me look so tough.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.620
As for the other characters,
Sean doesn't change,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.200
reckless and irresponsible in the beginning and the end.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.280
You're not like fifteen years old
or anything, are you?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.260
No, wait you're not like fifteen are you?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.800
It's the cops!

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.040
Erica changes,
from thinking of Mark's creation as a joke

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040
Good luck with your videogame.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.520
to using it herself.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.920
And finally,
Divya and the Winklevii don't change:

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.940
they are cocky insiders who
hide behind their family in the beginning,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.240
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.180
Colleagues of their father.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.140
and they are cocky insiders 
who hide behind their lawyer in the end.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.400
How would- how would you know? 
You weren't even there.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.200
Ty!

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.580
It's interesting what 
the filmmakers are doing here.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.160
The characters who created
Facebook are obsessive, instinctual outcasts,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.520
ones who tried to change the world to fit in with them.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.590
The characters who tried to create Facebook
but didn't are well-rounded, educated individuals

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.420
who don't need to change
because they already run things.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.260
And the characters who never
thought about changing the world,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.780
they are well-rounded,
educated individuals who change and fit in.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.600
It's also not a coincidence that these last
two are the likeable characters in this film.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.520
Well why don't you just concentrate 
on being the best you you can be?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.900
Did you really just say that?

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.780
I was kidding.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.240
So, what does it mean that obsessed,
instinctual outcasts changed the world,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.360
and well-rounded likeables and insiders don't?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.520
I think if your clients want to sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.660
they have a right to give it a try
but there is no requirement that I enjoy sitting here

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.220
listening to people lie.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.419
You have part of my attention,
you have the minimum amount.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.900
The rest of my attention is back at the
offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.020
are doing things that no one in this room,
including and especially your clients,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.360
are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.060
What does it mean that for some people
it is easier to change the world than it is to

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.800
change themselves?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.360
What are the filmmakers trying to say here?

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.480
All this once again brings us to what
The Social Network is really about

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.280
(last one, I promise).

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.680
David Fincher didn't go to film school;
he dove straight into filmmaking instead.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.060
And as a director he's definitely obsessed.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.279
Aaron Sorkin also never learned
screenwriting, he just picked it up and it clicked.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:01.449
I also think it's safe to say
that he is an obsessive.

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:06.720
And despite being Hollywood players,
they are still outcasts of sorts,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.960
making deep,
artistic films when that definitely is not in.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.440
Are these two changing the world?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.460
That's up for you to decide, but I think it's
pretty clear that they put themselves into this film.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.320
They opened themselves up and
spilled their guts, Sorkin on the page, Fincher on set.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.619
They did this so we could better
understand them, so they could better fit in.

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:33.310
Them and people like them.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.569
This is why I don't care how accurate the
characters are to their real-life counterparts:

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:42.509
the film isn't about the real-life counterparts;
it is about the people who created it,

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:44.440
and those who are like them.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.980
Like all great works of art, 
the artists put themselves on display in this piece,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:55.820
bleeding on the page, on the screen, showing us
who they are, what they think, how they see the world,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.589
what they believe, and how they feel.

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:02.620
And letting us connect with all that,
relate to it if we're like them,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.800
understand it if we're not.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.860
All of this, the personal, the openness,
the connections these filmmakers make,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.720
that is what The Social Network is really about.
