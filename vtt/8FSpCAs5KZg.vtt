00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.660
Hello viewers of Half as Interesting and welcome
to something that will completely worthless

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.830
for those of you who are colorblind.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.810
But to make it up to you, here: I got you
this gift card to Red Lobster.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.810
Enjoy!

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.650
So, colors are basically the way our eyes
interpret certain wavelengths of light.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.690
Generally, speaking, we’re only able to
see light that’s between 380 to 700 nanometers

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.000
in wavelength, with wavelength variations
determining color—for example, we interpret

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.340
light with a wavelength of 500 nanometers
as blue.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.660
There are also a ton of other types of light
that we can’t see—for example, we interpret

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.500
UV light with a wavelength of 100 nanometers
as skin cancer.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.380
As you go to longer wavelengths, there are
infrared, microwave, radar, and radio, and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.149
as you go to short wavelengths there are ultraviolet,
x-rays, gamma rays, Ray Romano, and Ray Donovan.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.740
But this little band in here is the visible
light spectrum, which you might also recognize

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.130
by its nickname, Roy G Biv, or its given name
Royland Grindlewald Biverston Jr.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.200
Now you may be wondering, “how do my eyes
know which colors are which?”

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.960
Well, in the back of your eyes, you’ve got
rods and cones.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.410
The rods do… something, but the cones do
a different thing: sense color.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.670
You’ve actually got three types of cones:
long cones, which are stimulated by red light,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.580
medium cones, stimulated by green light, and
short cones, stimulated by blue light.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.950
But as you’ve probably noticed, unless you’re
looking at the flag of Karelia or the three

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
worst Power Rangers, you usually see more
than red, green, and blue.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.850
That’s because the cones can also pick up
more than just their one pure color, as this

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.380
graph shows.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
So when you see yellow, that’s your long,
red cones picking up some stimulation, and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.150
the medium green cones picking up some, and
your eyes put that together, and see yellow,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.229
which is the wavelength between red and green.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.450
But now let’s talk about magenta: that purplish-red
color that you mostly know from T-Mobile ads

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.700
and the hair of manic pixie dream girls—but
if you look at the light spectrum, you’ll

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.059
notice that magenta isn’t on it.

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:18.730
There is no wavelength for magenta—and that’s
because magenta doesn’t actually exist.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.290
You see, magenta is what you get when your
eyes see both red and blue light at the same

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.150
time, stimulating your long and short cones.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.090
Normally, you’d think that when that happens,
your eyes would average the wavelengths, and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.349
you would end up in the middle, seeing green.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.599
But wait: your eyes know you aren’t seeing
green, because your green cones aren’t being

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.599
stimulated.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.860
But we had to see something, so our eyes panicked
and just made up magenta.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.499
That’s right: magenta is just like your
girlfriend who goes to another school—it’s

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.889
a figment of your imagination.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.099
But magenta is actually one of the least interesting
pieces of color confusion out there, because

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.090
even though there’s no wavelength for it,
we still see magenta all the time.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.939
The weirder, cooler, spookier side of color
theory comes via so-called impossible colors:

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.279
colors that theoretically exist, but that
we can’t usually see.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:18.049
There are four main types of impossible colors:
the first is hyperbolic colors.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.089
Let’s take, for example, hyperbolic green,
which surprisingly is not a new weed brand,

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.419
but instead an impossibly green color.

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.559
You see, because of overlaps in what wavelengths
our cones can pick up, our green cones can

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:36.409
never be stimulated on their own: there will
always be some stimulation of either red or

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.409
blue cones.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:43.309
But, if you were somehow able to just stimulate
the green cones, you would see hyperbolic

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.040
green: a green greener than any green that’s
ever greened.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.970
And there is actually a way to trick yourself
into seeing hyperbolic green: take magic mushrooms.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.499
Wait no, that’s not right: I meant, afterimages.

00:03:55.499 --> 00:04:00.760
You see, if you stare at magenta for a long
time, your red and blue cones get fatigued,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.369
so when you look away, you’ll see a green
afterimage, because magenta is the opposite

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.449
of green.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.180
If you then looked immediately at green, the
green afterimage will combine with the green

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.510
you’re looking at and you’ll see hyperbolic
green.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.999
Go ahead, try it.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.999
Seriously.

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.650
Put your face way too close to the screen,
the way you were always told not to.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.759
Now, stare at the magenta.

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.759
Keep staring.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.759
Keeep staring.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.470
Don’t get distracted by the little clown
in the corner of the screen.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.870
Okay, now look at the green!

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.699
Diiiid it look extra green?

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.710
Hopefully it did, but if not, you should do
what I do whenever anything goes wrong and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.360
blame my animators.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.789
Second up are stygian colors: colors that
are an impossible combination of dark and

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:41.789
saturated.

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.120
For example, stygian blue is seen as just
as dark as black, but also as blue, which

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.580
is normally impossible, because you know,
the only thing that’s as dark as black is,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.720
well, black.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.870
To see stygian blue, stare at this yellow,
then at black, but this time I’m gonna make

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.080
you pause the video to do it, because we’ve
got ads to get to.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.030
Third are self-luminous colors, which are
colors that appear impossibly bright.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.670
Whatever color you stare at first, you’ll
see the self-luminous version of its opposite.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.199
So, if you stare at this green, then at white,
you’ll see self-luminous red.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.740
Or this yellow, then white, and you’ll see
self-luminous blue.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.560
If you stare at this Luigi, then white, you’ll
see self-luminous Waluigi.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.750
Finally, there are impossible combination
colors.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.560
According to the theory of opponent-process,
you cannot see any colors that “could be

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.509
described as a combination of two colors on
opposite sides of the color wheel.”

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.440
Basically, that’s fancy science talk for
that you can see reddish-yellow, which is

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.979
basically orange, but you can’t see reddish-green.

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.319
If you mix red and green light, you see yellow,
if you mix red and green paint, you see brown.

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.580
Except that maybe you can see reddish-green
if you look at this and cross your eyes to

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.580
make them overlap.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.979
Did you see it?

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.050
Okay, now, if you keep your eyes crossed you
should see something else impossible…

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.710
