and in the meantime loki 

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:58.034
I'm asking for safe&nbsp;passage through the anus

00:00:58.034 --> 00:01:03.502
so the mcu's hop to TV  sure has been preoccupied with mental&nbsp;health, huh?

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:12.080
 james why does sam aggravate you and don't say something childish&nbsp;
first we had trauma as manifested by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
sci-fi magic and wanda vision look we've all&nbsp;
been there right letting our fear and anger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.398
get the best of us intentionally expanding&nbsp;
the borders of the false world we created

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.160
then we had ptsd and more trauma and lots of&nbsp;
therapy with falcon and the winter soldier look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.840
you've got to nurture friendships i am the only&nbsp;
person you have called all week that is so sad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.120
but then we took an interesting&nbsp;
turn into a mental disorder that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.360
is extremely popular as a character trait,&nbsp;
but rarely discussed in fiction with loki

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.000
i'm a narcissist then of course there's all&nbsp;
this discourse reacting to the text of the show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.320
is loki a narcissist?
 what a incredible seismic&nbsp;narcissist 
narcissism or narcissistic personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.880
disorders is one of the more common personality&nbsp;
disorders so it is kind of surprising that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.920
so widely misunderstood especially in light of&nbsp;
other mental illnesses like bipolar disorder or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.600
borderline personality disorder or ptsd gaining&nbsp;
much wider awareness in the last two decades most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.720
people don't seem to have a lot of interest in&nbsp;
it outside of demonizing it usually because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.040
know a narcissist or several and the perception&nbsp;
of what npd is is basically that of a psychopath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.760
with particularly high self-esteem narcissists&nbsp;
are primarily defined by their lack of empathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.200
you know what happens when someone upsets me&nbsp;
See how I glitter!
so there are so many fictional narcissists in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.480
media narcissists make great antagonists&nbsp;
and often sometimes even fun protagonists

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.680
it's fun to watch characters who are blind&nbsp;
to their own faults and lack self-awareness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.480
something less conspicuous processing

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.920
why am i so amazing?
 in comedies narcissists are&nbsp;well comedy gold because we get to enjoy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.120
juxtaposition of how they see themselves versus&nbsp;
the reality of how other people see them you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.560
desire smells like that to some people what is&nbsp;
that it smells like a turd covered in burnt hair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.160
the mcu has several prominent characters to&nbsp;
which the word narcissist has been applied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.360
obviously loki is up there then of course&nbsp;
there's thanos thanos exercises power to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.760
wipe out half the universe because he believes he&nbsp;
is the only one with the right solution to what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.560
he sees as a sickness and of course he sees&nbsp;
his children as an extension of himself and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.000
loves them if you're saying i play favorites&nbsp;
you're wrong i love all my children equally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.720
i don't care for nebula 
loves them extremely&nbsp;conditionally 
in order to take the stone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:10.000
you must lose that which you love 
you&nbsp;failed because you love nothing no one

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.560
hell one of the main characters&nbsp;
of the mcu tony stark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.440
debatably tiptoes up to the line of qualifying&nbsp;for the disorder 
it is one thing to question the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.760
official story and another thing entirely to&nbsp;
make wild accusations or insinuate that i'm a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.360
superhero i never said you're a superhero didn't&nbsp;
well good because that would be outlandish and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.160
uh fantastic 
in order to better understand what&nbsp;the disorder is before we get into loki let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.320
walk through what might qualify someone for having&nbsp;
npd using everyone's favorite narcissistic mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.280
lucille bluth 
everything they do is so dramatic&nbsp;and flamboyant it just makes me want to set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.200
myself on fire
 narcissistic personality disorder&nbsp;is defined by the presence of at least five of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.120
the following nine criteria a grandiose sense of&nbsp;self-importance 
what the hell was i supposed to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.720
michael moore confronted me in front of the whole&nbsp; country 
first of all it wasn't michael moore it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.400
was a michael moore look alike and it wasn't&nbsp;
in front of the whole country it was for a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.840
on jimmy kimmel live 
i don't know who that is&nbsp;and i don't care to find out 
a preoccupation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.800
with fantasies of unlimited success power&nbsp;brilliance beauty or ideal love 
tell me the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.480
okay cause there's been a lot of lying in this&nbsp;family 
and a lot of love 
a belief that he or she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.200
is special and unique and can only be understood&nbsp;
by or should associate with other special or high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.640
status people or institutions
 are you aware that&nbsp;we've been downgraded to being just pool members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.560
at the club now?
 yeah it's a real shame what's&nbsp;going on with this family you're stuck by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.760
pool and dad's getting picked last for softball&nbsp;
a need for excessive admiration 
it's not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.480
mother boy it's mother motherboy30 and i think&nbsp;
with you i've got a shot 
a sense of entitlement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.760
what's spanish for i know you speak english&nbsp;
interpersonally exploitative behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.440
did you and dad adopt a child?
 he must have forged&nbsp;my signature 
well maybe i'll get a son who will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:17.680
finish his cottage cheese 
a lack of empathy &nbsp;
I want to cry so bad but i don't think i can spare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:26.080
the moisture 
one lousy ci--
oh honey they're&nbsp;just heels they can only support so much weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.480
envy of others or a belief that others are envious of him or her 
she's trying to prove that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.200
closer to my children than i am but the joke's&nbsp;
on her because she doesn't know how little i care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.760
for GOB
a demonstration of arrogant and haughty&nbsp;behaviors or attitudes 
take it back if i wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.880
something your thumb touched i'd eat the inside&nbsp;of your ear 
so these are just the DSM criteria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.960
but there are many more behaviors and symptoms&nbsp;associated with the disorder 
i know when i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.760
not wanted 
narcissists don't feel responsible for&nbsp;their own conduct but they will always hold others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.800
accountable for any transgression real or imagined&nbsp;
narcissists have an almost comically short memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.120
for their own behaviors and will frequently&nbsp;
rewrite history to suit their own narrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:19.440
i put the fires out 
you made them worse 
worse&nbsp;or better?
 narcissists are also perpetual victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.840
they often use the language of social justice to&nbsp;
reassure others that their victimhood is quite&nbsp;real&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:31.120
that palace you live in up there on that&nbsp;
hill i gave my life to my children on a silver&nbsp;&nbsp;platter

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.760
the admiration of others is a salve to&nbsp;
shield them from the perception of vulnerability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.520
it's important to remember that victimhood&nbsp;
and vulnerability are not the same thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.040
i was the world's nicest guy and they ruined my&nbsp;
life for no reason. see just like i said i'm the&nbsp;&nbsp;victim here

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.480
but while narcissists frequently frame&nbsp;
themselves as the victims of injustice they tend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.360
to be outraged when other people claim victimhood&nbsp;
especially when it counters their own narrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.520
you are fake crying that is not real 
as a victim&nbsp;of abuse myself 
oh my god you are so manipulative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.440
god oh my god i was molested i have been oh my god 
But learned i am an empath right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.520
narcissists also aren't capable of love&nbsp;
in the way that neurotypical people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.200
which is why it's so hard for the children of&nbsp;
narcissists to admit that their parents are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.680
fact narcissists because it's difficult to accept&nbsp;
that your parent doesn't really love you in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.240
that a parent should because narcissistic parents&nbsp;
don't see their children as autonomous people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:34.160
but as extensions of themselves 
i see a strong&nbsp;confident beautiful young lady oh look you're&nbsp;&nbsp;here too

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.800
i'm just teasing stop taking everything&nbsp;so seriously. 
Narcissists seek affection and approval&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.400
but remain indifferent to any harm they themselves&nbsp;
cause interpersonal boundaries to a narcissist are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.160
a form of abuse 
after everything i've done for&nbsp;you
that i didn't ask for 
do you have any idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.640
of the work you're undoing 
love to a narcissist&nbsp;isn't caring for another person's emotional needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.840
but controlling them 
suddenly he's too much of&nbsp;a big shot to brush mother's hair 
well i'm not--

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.200
now with all that said, there are a lot of common&nbsp;
misconceptions of narcissism the first is that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.840
narcissists are extremely self-confident 
they're&nbsp;all so beautiful. why don't i have three heads?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.000
this is not true what appears as confidence is&nbsp;
often a thin veneer hiding feelings of shame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.200
self-doubt and self-hatred obsessive&nbsp;
self-loathing is a form of narcissism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.040
narcissists are usually oblivious to hurt they&nbsp;
cause others often hurtful behavior is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.760
collateral damage to having their emotional&nbsp;needs met 
i do everything i can to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.880
and all you can do is drink and talk nonsense and&nbsp;frighten me 
go back to bed 
narcissists are evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.040
i told dwight that there is honor and losing&nbsp;
which as we all know is completely ridiculous but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.560
there is however honor in making a loser feel&nbsp;
better which is what i just did for dwight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.760
the reality is that narcissists may behave in&nbsp;
hurtful ways but they are not inherently evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:18.240
would i rather be feared or loved um easy both i&nbsp;
want people to be afraid of how much they love me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.880
narcissistic personality disorder does not&nbsp;
implicate any kind of off-kilter moral barometer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.360
there is nothing wrong with a narcissist's impulse&nbsp;
control or their ability to tell right from wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.680
quite the opposite in some ways narcissists&nbsp;
are not only able to discern right from wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.920
they for the most part want to do right&nbsp;
again because they want to be liked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.200
for me to be attracted to a woman she has to&nbsp;
be as intelligent or slightly less intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.560
than me she is you know 
narcissists all come&nbsp;from a background of privilege people have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.800
very specific idea that narcissists come from&nbsp;
a certain background they are privileged they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.320
come from wealth and power and that is sometimes&nbsp;
true but anyone from any background can develop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.880
the disorder although there is no one cause for&nbsp;
narcissism it rarely emerges in people who come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.720
from stable loving families 
i'd rather smother&nbsp;them with a pillow than take them to nevada&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.520
always with the drama 
it is often the result of&nbsp;trauma or emotional neglect and for those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.000
perceive wealth and power the wealth and power&nbsp;
is used to shield an incredibly fragile ego&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.440
you clearly don't know who you're talking to so&nbsp;
let me clue you in i am not in danger skyler i am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.080
the danger a guy opens his door and gets shot&nbsp;
and you think that of me no i am the one who&nbsp;&nbsp;knocks

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.880
but one of the more common misconceptions&nbsp;
is the conflation of narcissism with psychopathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.840
this idea that narcissists don't experience hurt&nbsp;
or pain or even their own you know version of love

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.160
narcissists especially female narcissists actually&nbsp;
live in a constant state of anxiety and boy do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.560
they want you to know that 
hope you have children&nbsp;of your own and they treat you like this &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.160
I gave my life to my children on a silver platter&nbsp;this is bullsh*t
 so here's why narcissists aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.320
just psychopaths with high self-esteem psychopaths&nbsp;
don't really care what other people think of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.960
they don't care about their lives and they don't&nbsp;
experience empathy where a narcissist is defined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.360
by a preoccupation with what other people think&nbsp;
of them they are constantly reshaping themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.360
to fit whatever mold they think will serve&nbsp;them best
 i'm prison mike you know why they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.720
call me prison mike?
 do you really expect us to&nbsp;believe you're somebody else?
do you really expect me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.440
to not push you up against a wall biot--
some narcissists do this by being charming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:39.920
i am a writer a doctor a nuclear physicist a&nbsp;
theoretical philosopher but above all i am a man

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.480
hopelessly inquisitive man just&nbsp;like you 
some by being manipulative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:54.320
tears aren't a woman's only weapon 
some by being&nbsp;controlling and some downright authoritarian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:02.400
it's the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave&nbsp;subjugation 
but a true narcissist doesn't live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.520
a state of cold self-assuredness rather they live&nbsp;
in a constant state of anxiety and hyper vigilance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.440
you don't know what goes through this&nbsp;mind of mine 
well that's for f*****g sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.560
but narcissism in itself is not unhealthy there&nbsp;
is what is called healthy narcissism and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.760
healthy to exhibit some narcissistic traits you&nbsp;
do actually need some narcissism for a healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.680
functioning psyche and that is the sort of thing&nbsp;
that lets you stand up for yourself when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.840
being treated unfairly 
i am a khaleesi of the&nbsp;dothraki the next time you raise a hand to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.720
will be the last time you have hands 
so with all&nbsp;that groundwork out of the way the big question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.840
is loki a narcissist?
 sorry about that time i&nbsp;turned you into a frog 
it was a wonderful joke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:55.440
it was indeed hilarious 
well depends on which&nbsp;loki the most lovable version of loki the loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.080
from thor ragnarok 
i have been falling for 30&nbsp;minutes 
is probably the most narcissistic the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.560
movie begins with him watching a play glorifying&nbsp;
his part in the previous film 
i'm sorry about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:14.640
thing with the tesseract i just couldn't help&nbsp;myself i'm a trickster 
yes, just so mischievous &nbsp;

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:21.760
he spends the entire movie caring not at all about&nbsp;
thor or whatever is going on in sakhar feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.640
no empathy for thor when he's getting the sh*t
kicked out of him in fact enjoys it as a form of retribution

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.840
that's how it feels!

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.000
i'm just a huge fan of the sport 
and in&nbsp;the end any altruistic action he takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.120
is ultimately because it's the best action&nbsp;
for him 
suddenly you're overcome with an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.960
urge to do the right thing 
heavens no i've&nbsp;run out of favor with the grand master&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.240
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship&nbsp;
i'm asking for safe passage through the anus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.880
and sure he saves the day at the end but not out&nbsp;
of a sense of empathy but out of the you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:02.160
correct sense that this path is the one that will&nbsp;
get him the most adulation 
your savior is here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:10.400
contrast this with the loki in loki he displays&nbsp;
narcissistic traits but basically completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.960
falls short of having the disorder in the very&nbsp;
first episode 
i don't enjoy hurting people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:27.600
i do it because i have to because i've had to it's&nbsp;
the cruel elaborate trick conjured by the weak to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.400
inspire fear 
the desperate play for control 
he&nbsp;loves his mother not as an extension of himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.000
but for her own sake and is protective of her&nbsp;safety 
where is she? 
now why don't you tell me do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.840
you enjoy hurting people do you enjoy killing&nbsp;
i'll kill you 
what like you did your mother

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.320
sylvia is self-taught but loki 
someone taught&nbsp;you fairly decent magic 
my mother 

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.800
then there's&nbsp;the interaction with sif where he comes to a&nbsp;
conclusion about his personal failings on his own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.480
i crave attention because i'm

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.320
i'm a narcissist it's because&nbsp;
i'm scared of being alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.960
a true narcissist would continue to deflect&nbsp;
blame when confronted with all the timeline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.880
stuff he had in store for him he wouldn't&nbsp;
accept responsibility and he certainly wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.240
have an honest come to jesus moment after being&nbsp;
punched in the head 400 times by the same person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.560
i'm a narcissist 
he might say something&nbsp;manipulative to get her to stop hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.560
but the Sif time loop would not bring about&nbsp;
an honest moment of self-reflection in a true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.600
narcissist again narcissists are eternal&nbsp;
victims they are pathologically incapable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.360
of self-reflection if it doesn't come from&nbsp;
an outside source that they care about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.200
also vulnerability is anathema to a narcissist but&nbsp;
loki allows himself to be vulnerable several times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.960
most relevant to the discussion in the discourse&nbsp;
and indeed in the show itself is what he sees in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.320
sylvie his alternate universe self specifically in&nbsp;
the moments before he thinks they're both about to&nbsp;die

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.960
you were just a child when the tva took you&nbsp;
but you nearly took down the organization that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.160
claims to govern the order of time you did it on&nbsp;
your own you ran rings around them you're amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.320
clearly there are elements of him looking at her&nbsp;
and seeing aspects of what he could have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.960
but ultimately the virtues that he appreciates&nbsp;
in sylvie aren't really virtues that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.320
shares a common tactic when narcissists compliment&nbsp;
other people is that they are really complimenting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.400
themselves but loki isn't doing that here&nbsp;
like they're variations on the same person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.480
but they are still two completely different people&nbsp;
the contradiction of loki as a show is that much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.920
of the tension comes from loki's history of&nbsp;
narcissism his history of narcissism is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.720
makes him the most likely in the room to betray&nbsp;anyone at any given point
 you're really good at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.600
doing awful things and then just getting away 
what&nbsp;can i say i'm a mischievous scamp
 while at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.120
time most likely to do whatever it takes to be&nbsp;
liked or gain power there's this constant tension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.800
of will he betray mobius will he betray sylvie&nbsp;
oh mobius come on what could possibly go wrong we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.680
got to properly test this theory 
well here's a fun&nbsp;theory you lure me out into the field and then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.080
stab me in the back and that's a theory i don't&nbsp;want to test 
i can't sleep in a place like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.520
you can't sleep on a train? 
no i can't&nbsp;sleep around untrustworthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.520
but in the end aside from a couple of very&nbsp;
justified moments of self-preservation the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:29.040
loki in the tv show betrays nobody six episodes&nbsp;
nary a betrayal that wasn't earned 
i'm staying

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.440
which is why the ending sylvie's assumption&nbsp;
that he intends to betray her while the rando&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.080
at the end of time chews the scenery makes&nbsp;
the conclusion of the show ring kind of hollow

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.440
you want the throne 
no 
no sylvie this does&nbsp;not comport with the person that you have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:59.120
interacting with during this series 
that's what&nbsp;you think of me after all this time sure why not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.520
evil loki's master plan comes together 
because&nbsp;the loki you have been interacting with never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.240
acted like a self-serving narcissist he's actually&nbsp;
pretty self-sacrificial you've both risked your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:16.400
life for each other several times by now 
loki i&nbsp;don't even know if this is going to work 
you go, I go.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.400
it's almost like you've been&nbsp;
watching all the movies we saw before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.840
so from movie to movie to tv show i think it's&nbsp;
fair to say that loki's writing is inconsistent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.280
npd is not a disorder that you can character arc&nbsp;
your way out of by definition it is incurable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.320
so if you want to incorporate the loki of disney+&nbsp;
 loki into loki's greater journey but i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.920
think he's badly written but he's not an honest&nbsp;
portrayal of a narcissist ten is a true narcissist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:48.320
i give him a seven maybe an eight 
absolutely&nbsp;not this is fine asgardian leather 

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.200
but this is not to say that the mcu doesn't have anything&nbsp;
meaningful to say about narcissism the best most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.400
honest portrayal in the mcu of a narcissist is&nbsp;not loki nor is it thanos but 
my name is ego

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:10.640
and i'm your dad peter 
uh oh have we found an excuse&nbsp;to fawn over guardians of the galaxy vol 2 again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.751
yes yes yes yes we have 
i thought yondu was&nbsp;your father you look exactly alike 
one's blue

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.680
so in a lot of ways guardians of the galaxy vol 2&nbsp;
is the rare movie that makes the first one better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.760
in retrospect a lot of the boomer nostalgia&nbsp;
from the first movie that just felt kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:37.120
random and atmospheric and maybe a little&nbsp;pandery 
ooh child things will get brighter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.000
and bring it down hard 
now with the context of&nbsp;the second movie feels a lot more thoughtful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.840
take for instance the soundtracks and the song&nbsp;
in guardians 2 that serves as a through line

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:57.520
you know uh brandy by looking glass 
on first blush&nbsp;when we first meet cgi de-aged kurt russell and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.680
peter's mom you're like yeah that's a fun 70s love&nbsp;
song how quaint i will take one nostalgia please

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.574
but as the movie unfolds the ugly&nbsp;
undertones become more and more apparent

00:21:27.163 --> 00:21:32.000
you know peter you and i we're we're the sailor&nbsp;in that song 
the sailor in the song doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.200
care about brandy at all he's all about his own&nbsp;
pleasure his own goals and he frames it like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:45.440
a good fun thing
Sea calls upon him as history calls&nbsp;upon great men 
there is zero remorse in the song&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.200
which is why ego is drawn to it and to a certain&nbsp;
extent peter 
It was one of earth's greatest musical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.920
compositions perhaps its very greatest 
yeah yes&nbsp;
guardians 2 is about family comma what makes one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.880
but largely it's also about how ego negatively&nbsp;
affects relationships both the literal character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.160
ego and the concept of narcissism itself 
they&nbsp;told me you people were conceited douche bags&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.760
but that isn't true at all 
rocket steals&nbsp;batteries because the sovereign offended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.000
his ego the sovereign's motivation for revenge&nbsp;
throughout the entire movie is ego 

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.560
our concern&nbsp;&nbsp;is their slight against our people 
peter and&nbsp;rocket nearly kill everybody trying to prove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.280
that they are the superior pilot ego 
peter we&nbsp;almost died because of your arrogance 

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.800
so ego operates as the perfect portrait of a&nbsp;
narcissist he can't understand other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.240
people's motivations that don't directly serve&nbsp;him 
but instead of returning you yondu kept you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.240
i have no clue as to why 
and challenging&nbsp;questions that center other people's needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.800
why didn't you come back why did you send yondu&nbsp;
a criminal of all people to come 
well we're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:57.440
gonna change the subject 
i've made many mistakes&nbsp;peter but you're not one of them there's so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.320
that i need to teach you about this planet 
but at&nbsp;the same time ego is also good at charming people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.560
and with peter he's good at giving peter&nbsp;
validation that feels like validation but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.640
really it's just ego complimenting himself 
and&nbsp;who the hell are you 
i figured my rugged good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:24.240
looks would make that obvious 
i can explain your&nbsp;very special heritage 
out of all my spawn only you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:31.200
carry the connection to the light 
but most of all&nbsp;he sees everyone as either an extension of himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.600
or a potential extension of himself peter&nbsp;
is valuable to him when peter is willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.680
perform that role but the second he behaves&nbsp;autonomously 
you really need to grow up

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.680
but like ego peter is also extremely narcissistic&nbsp;
that's why he nearly falls for ego's plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.720
it's because that place was real and this is&nbsp;a fantasy 
i get it you're jealous because i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.000
part god and you like when i'm the weak one&nbsp;
ego tells him he is special he's powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.360
and without the planet that is ego he's not&nbsp;special anymore 
you are a god if you kill me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.840
you'll be just like everybody&nbsp;else 
peter's narcissism is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.840
main thing getting in the way with his&nbsp;
relationship with gamora because well

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.920
she's already lived through escaping one&nbsp;
narcissist in her life so her hesitation is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.360
understandable this is why i hate infinity war&nbsp;
anyway this line for instance 
you know what this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:37.840
is not cheers after all 
i don't know what cheers&nbsp;is 
it's played for laughs but it's very revealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.720
he's whining about his needs and he doesn't even&nbsp;
care that she doesn't know what he's talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:50.960
my life my love my lady is the sea 
there's a lot&nbsp;of heavy stuff in this movie that is couched in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.000
comedy arguably by necessity because if you&nbsp;
seriously mull on what's happening in certain&nbsp;scenes

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.200
yondu is the guy who abducted me kicked&nbsp;
the crap out of me so i could learn to fight and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.080
kept me in terror by threatening to eat me 
it's&nbsp;actually pretty disturbing 
you said you were&nbsp;gonna eat me

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.240
 that was being funny 
not to me
 but the other side of the coin to the effects of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.640
narcissistic parent is mantis who is functionally&nbsp;also ego's child 
he raised me by hand and kept me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:27.200
as his own 
so you're a pet
i suppose 
mantis&nbsp;is an empath 
because you're empathic 

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.640
so i'm an&nbsp;empath i've heard that before i've learned i am&nbsp;an empath right 
No, Shane like a real one. 

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.440
Empaths feel feelings 
particularly relevant because&nbsp;narcissists prey on other people's empathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.920
children of narcissistic parents frequently learn&nbsp;
to shapeshift as a survival mechanism the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.040
thing mantis does in the film is laugh at drax's&nbsp;
practical joke even though she clearly hates it

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.840
that is called a practical joke

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.440
children of narcissists tend to either be&nbsp;
pathological pleasers or very cold they either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.760
exhaust themselves in a lifetime of trying to&nbsp;please the unpleasable 
As a child my father would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.960
gamora and me better one another in training every&nbsp;
time my sister prevailed my father would replace a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.200
piece of me with machinery 
Or they stonewall&nbsp;everyone they enter an intimate relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.000
with every time there's conflict so a lot of&nbsp;
mantis's scenes are couched in comedy because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.400
she is deeply traumatized so a lot of the&nbsp;
expression of her trauma is framed for laughs&nbsp;because

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:40.160
this gross bug lady is my new friend&nbsp;
i'm learning many things like i'm a pet and ugly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.480
otherwise it would be a bit too heavy in a movie&nbsp;like this 
i'm Mary Poppins y'all!
so given the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.280
the mcu utilizes narcissists/protagonists&nbsp;
who while not being narcissistic to the point of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:59.200
disorder are extremely narcissistic there is a&nbsp;
success here we love narcissistic characters we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.480
see the narcissism of the protagonist in ourselves&nbsp;
and the narcissism of the villains is just fun to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:10.320
watch they are memorable 
i am a god you dull&nbsp;creature and i will not be bullied by a--

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.320
so it's interesting to me that we hate irl&nbsp;
narcissists so much why is that? in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.280
ways it's the same reason why addicts loathe&nbsp;
alcoholics or why people with anger issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.200
loathe domestic abusers we hate the most in&nbsp;
others the thing we fear the most in ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.680
so the funny thing about loki is we loved loki the&nbsp;
narcissist as long as the word narcissist wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:43.200
trotted out because the moment it is trotted out&nbsp;
what a incredible seismic narcissist 
he has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.040
stop being a narcissist in order to remain likable&nbsp;
and then suddenly he's mr empathy his behavior is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.720
no longer disordered but relatable he's no longer&nbsp;
a narcissist but wrestling with his own narcissism

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.400
this isn't about you 
that said it's really&nbsp;common for people to talk about having been in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.360
relationships with people with other personality&nbsp;
disorders and maybe it was extremely difficult but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.080
they don't talk about those people in terms of&nbsp;
a condition that must be fundamentally avoided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.080
it's framed as a mental illness so&nbsp;
why don't we talk about narcissists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.960
in the same way why are narcissists always&nbsp;
spiders who capture people in their web&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.760
rather than people with behavioral disorders that&nbsp;
don't have the tools to manage their disorder the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.480
worst thing about narcissists isn't that they're&nbsp;
narcissists most of them want to be good people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.640
they thrive off validation the worst thing about&nbsp;
narcissists is they never seek treatment for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.840
condition because they don't want the stigma of&nbsp;
being a narcissist so therefore they never admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.280
that they are and they never stop hurting the&nbsp;
people that they care about you know in their way

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.960
this is especially true for&nbsp;
narcissistic parents of adult children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:59.200
why did you adopt me?
 because i wanted&nbsp;someone to love 
don't you act for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.600
again this is a really common thing children&nbsp;
of narcissists will notice about their parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.000
they believe they're good people doing the right&nbsp;
thing and they just don't understand why their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.880
children don't want to talk to them no matter&nbsp;
how many times their children have explained it

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.960
both yondu and ego were sh*t parents ego the&nbsp;
narcissist and yondu the abusive and neglectful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.640
adoptive father but in the end one&nbsp;
of them was able to see their child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.400
as more than just an extension of themselves&nbsp;
and that is what sets him apart as a parent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.320
i'm sorry i didn't do none of it right i'm damn&nbsp;lucky you're my boy 
so fictional narcissists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:49.520
occupy an interesting space with regard to the&nbsp;
way we engage with real life narcissists frost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.160
giants and mad titans and living planets aren't&nbsp;
real but people with narcissistic personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.960
disorder are and according to some studies up&nbsp;
to five percent of all humans have narcissistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.320
personality disorder a lot of people claim to&nbsp;
have narcissistic parents not because it's trendy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.680
well not just because it's trendy but also just&nbsp;
because it's a really common disorder so what have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:20.160
we learned from these fictional examples of how to&nbsp;
deal with narcissists well either they character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:27.280
arc their way into a cure or we kill them a&nbsp;
narcissist can't cure their condition in the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:33.520
way that someone with less stigmatized disorders&nbsp;
like major depression or borderline personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:40.880
disorder or bipolar disorder can't cure theirs but&nbsp;
that doesn't mean they can't evolve or improve as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:48.000
people it's not curable but it is treatable and&nbsp;
the hardest hurdle here is usually to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.720
narcissist to want treatment in the first place so&nbsp;
aside from a pretty disappointing last episode i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:01.600
really did enjoy loki and i don't want to imply&nbsp;
that the show is a failure because it made him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:08.480
less narcissistic in the service of making him&nbsp;
more likeable i just think that result is a show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:15.280
that doesn't have a lot to say about narcissism&nbsp;
despite trying to and it leaves me wondering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.360
is it even possible to destigmatize narcissistic&nbsp;
personality disorder in the way that things like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:27.440
bipolar disorder or major depression have lost&nbsp;
their stigma in the last few decades and if so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.360
what would that look like disney is an evil&nbsp;
mega hydra that is rapidly covering the land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.160
in darkness but there is something to be said&nbsp;
for the fact that not only do they feel safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.240
making these narratives but that they've turned&nbsp;
them into some of the most popular television&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.720
of the streaming era so far i didn't really&nbsp;
touch on falcon and the winter soldier because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.720
honestly i thought it was pretty boring&nbsp;
but i do think it's worth mentioning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.200
that this is the only one of these series that&nbsp;
integrates any discussion on therapy or how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.840
live with mental illness which loki doesn't&nbsp;
because you know it's not that kind of show

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.640
not every piece of media that deals with&nbsp;
mental illness needs to integrate some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.840
portion about like medication or therapy&nbsp;
or whatever 
are you still having nightmares

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.840
no 
but if you look at these three and how&nbsp;they all take such different approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.360
to exploring mental illness through&nbsp;
fiction it's interesting that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:28.160
such a through line with the new direction&nbsp;marvel is going 
ask your doctor about nexus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:34.640
a unique antidepressant that works to anchor you&nbsp;
back to your reality or the reality of your choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.560
side effects include feeling your feelings&nbsp;
confronting your truth seizing your destiny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.240
and possibly more depression 
right now it's&nbsp;less here is the conflict and more how did the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.520
conflict shape these characters which does kind&nbsp;
of become a problem with shows like WandaVision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.920
where in the end we still kind of have to punch&nbsp;
our way out of the conflict but whatever it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.200
been nominated for like 80 emmys clearly they're&nbsp;
doing something right 
and i killed sparky too

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.880
so i don't want to give disney too much credit&nbsp;
here but i think there is some value to these pop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.800
culture artifacts designed for mass consumption&nbsp;
normalizing these discussions because i've seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:21.440
it help a lot of people find the language for&nbsp;
their own traumas or even in the case of loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.040
their own relationship to their own narcissism&nbsp;
that maybe they haven't really processed yet and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:36.000
can only surmise that you guys are hungry for more&nbsp;
content about toxic narcissistic parents so smooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.040
so my first book axioms end is a kindle deal of&nbsp;
the month uh it's only $2.99 on amazon for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.280
entire months of september it also just&nbsp;
came out in paperback here's the paperback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.320
i treat my books very well and if you want&nbsp;
to know how this ties in with the theme of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.280
narcissistic parents well i guess you'll just have&nbsp;
to read it to find out and if you're into exploring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.920

my second book comes out on october 12th this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.320
not the final version so i'm allowed to abuse
this one this is an advanced reader copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.400

book comes out anyway you can pre-order signed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:18.640
copies of that in the link below but maybe you're&nbsp;

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:26.320
insatiable and maybe you're wondering where do i&nbsp;
keep all my videos that are too spicy for youtube&nbsp;&nbsp;
