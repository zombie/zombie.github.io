00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.960
So, I hear you might be thinking about killing the author.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.960
it’s an exciting time in any person’s
life when they’re deciding which literary

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.330
theory to apply to the way they read texts,
but it’s important to know what you’re

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.210
getting into, and make sure that this literary
theory is the right one for you.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.390
What is it about death of the author that
appeals to you, the reader? Before you start

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.000
applying literary theories, you want to make
sure that you’re doing it for the right reasons.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.020
There are an awful lot of young people out
there who rush into death of the author without

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.780
really understanding its intended purpose.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.210
Are you trying to enhance your understanding
of a text by secluding yourself from authorial

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.980
intent or a body of work, or are you trying
to excuse yourself from potential guilt when

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.960
you find out that your favorite author might
be a shitbag, and you don’t want to examine

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.460
what that author does with their platform?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.210
There are a lot of people out there who advocate
separating art from the artist so they won’t

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.439
have to examine the ethics of consuming art
from people who use their platform to do things

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.350
that might be a little iffy.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.520
Maybe even harmful.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.100
Before we jump in, we need to understand that
applying a literary theory and examining the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.670
ethics of watching the usual suspects knowing
now what we know about its director and star

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.190
are two very separate issues.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.620
And it can be confusing, and you need to be
careful not to conflate the two.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.670
With that in mind, let’s talk about death
of the author.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.100
Is death of the author right for you? Are
you ready to kill the author? And is death

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.880
of the author really even possible to apply
to any text in our platform- and personal-brand-obsessed culture?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.120
Well today we’re going to talk about that,
learn a little something, and maybe...

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.680
even have a little fun.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.700
The fault in our stars is a 2012 novel written
by John Green.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930
The plot of the novel revolves around two
teenagers named Hazel Grace Lancaster and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.769
Augustus Waters, the former living with terminal
cancer and the latter in remission from his,

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.519
as they begin a relationship.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.470
In the process of developing their relationship,
Hazel Grace shares her favorite book of all

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.989
time, "An Imperial Affliction" by a man named
Peter Van Houten, with Augustus.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.340
Though she loves the book, the book’s ambiguous
ending is a source of consternation for Hazel,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.519
and she longs for nothing more than for the
notoriously reclusive Van Houten to tell her

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.519
what happens after the book ends.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.829
And so Augustus, having banked his wish from
the make a wish foundation, uses that wish

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.420
to make a trip to Amsterdam with hazel and
her mother to meet Van Houten.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.400
But when they finally meet Van Houten, the two
find not the kind, empathetic author that they

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.019
imagined, but a drunken misanthrope who refuses
to answer their questions.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.810
"I can no more tell you what happens to her
than I can tell you what becomes of Proust's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.609
Narrator or Holden Caufield's sister or Huckleberry
Finn after he lights out for the territories"

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.180
What happens after the book ends is nothing,
he insists. The book is fiction.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.189
It didn’t happen.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.469
It’s not real.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.480
To which a livid Hazel Grace responds:

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480
"BULLSHIT.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.060
That's bulllshit.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.110
Just tell me!

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
Make something up!"

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.730
Hazel has tied the idea that there is a life
for these characters after the book ends with

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.760
her own narrative - she needs to believe that
there is a life for these characters

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.790
beyond the text, because she sees so much
of herself in the text, right down to the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.290
protagonist living with terminal cancer.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.849
But in the end, the author of her favorite
book has no answer for her.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.799
And when, months later, feeling guilty about
the way their interaction had ended, Van Houten does

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.879
come up with an answer, but Hazel no longer
wants to know - so neither she nor we, the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.169
reader, find out the fictional author’s
intent.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.260
Furthermore, "The Fault in our Stars" itself has
an ambiguous ending - we do not find out what

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.379
becomes of Hazel Grace - how much longer,
if at all, Hazel survives her disease.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.129
As a solitary text unto itself, "The Fault
in our Stars" could be read as an argument

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.140
in favor of death of the author.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.319
Not only is the author completely unlike what
the leads expect him to be, the author has

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.569
no answers for them.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.529
Seeking his authorial intent is an exercise
in futility - the author has emotionally moved

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:20.199
on from the book, and if he does have an answer
to Hazel’s question, he is not obligated

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.200
to share it.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.500
But moreover, his intent does not matter - the
book does not speak to Hazel because of the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.440
author’s intent, but because of the text
itself.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.479
The text in isolation is what means so much
to Hazel.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.449
As a text, this seems to be the theme of "The Fault in our Stars"  - that a part of growing up is to stop

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.490
looking to other people, especially authors,
to explain the meaning behind texts, but instead

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.289
to figure out what your own reading is.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.699
Of course, we can’t know if this was the
author’s intent based on the text alone.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.840
Fortunately, thanks to the magic of the internet,
we do know exactly what the author thinks.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.319
In a 2014 tweet, Green got a lot of attention
and ten thousand retweets with the proclamation,

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.590
“Books belong to their readers.”

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.449
Green elaborated on that stance in an interview
in 2014: "I think authorial intent is pretty

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.400
irrelevant, and I tend to agree with the school
of literary criticism that proclaims the death

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.810
of the author."

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.539
When pressed on what happens after the end
of "The Fault in our Stars" in a way that remarkably

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.840
mirrors the way Hazel presses Van Houten,
Green stated in a now-deleted 2012 blog entry:

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.710
“I’m different from Peter Van Houten in
many important ways, but in this respect (and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.980
some others) we are the same: I have access
to the exact same text that you do.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.890
My thoughts about the world outside of that
text are not any more informed or authoritative

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.890
than yours.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.060
It’s not my book.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.060
It’s your book.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.340
I don’t make decisions about things that
happen outside the text of the book; I can’t

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.189
read something that isn’t there any more
than you can."

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:50.389
It’s kind of rare to find an author with strong opinions on the concept of death of the author,

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.850
who goes out of their way not only to avoid
making comments on what happens outside of

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.610
the text, but to bake that very notion into
the text itself.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.610
But, of course, Green’s approach is not
the only one.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.979
If we’re talking about inserting authorial
intent into texts well after they have been

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.040
published, then we need to talk about the
hippogriff in the room.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.300
But first!

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.680
In 1967, French literary critic and theorist,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.220
Roland Barthes published his essay, "La mort
de l’auteur," or “The Death of the Author,”

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.300
which was published in English the following
year.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.250
The simplest reduction of the essay’s thesis
is that readers should pull away from the

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.139
tenet of traditional literary criticism that
focused on authorial intent, and instead adopt

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.960
a more text oriented approach that focused
on the interaction between the reader and the text,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.400
not between reader and the author.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.009
But to understand how this idea first came about--first,
we need to put ourselves into the headspace

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.789
of French academia in the mid-1960s.

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:06.340
Across academia, but particularly in Humanities-related
fields like literature, linguistics, philosophy,

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.939
and anthropology, we were seeing a trend away
from a Structuralist methodology--i.e., a

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:15.780
methodology that saw facets of human culture
as intrinsically related to a broader, overarching

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.759
system or structure--
By the 1960s, academia had now saw itself

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.199
trending towards a “post-structuralist”
point of view, fueled by thinkers like Foucalt,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.140
Barthes, and my good friend Derrida.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.300
Post-structuralism questioned the more binary
relationship of structuralism--that you couldn’t

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.710
make X assumption about X person/social group/work
of art just because X person came from a certain

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.120
place, experienced a certain thing, spoke
a certain language, ate a certain thing for

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.039
breakfast, etc.

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.099
And if it’s beginning to sound like “post-structuralism”
involves a lot of complicated French naval-gazing

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:51.849
academic bloviating, that’s because it does.

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:55.770
But for the purposes of keeping this short
and sweet, we’ll keep our discussion of

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.129
post-structuralism contained to where it concerns
Barthes, and novelists.

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:04.060
In "Death of the Author," Barthes argues that
“Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.819
space where our subject slips away, the negative
where all identity is lost, starting with

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.689
the very identity of the body writing.”

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:15.979
In other words, Barthes argues that a piece
of text is fundamentally divorced from the

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:16.979
author who made it.

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:20.199
And if it seems like a simple concept now,
keep in mind:

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:25.020
In particular to the literary and visual arts,
up until the 1960s, much of a creator’s work

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.669
in academia was examined through a lense that
tied together said creator and their life.

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:33.290
Biography was king in helping to interpret
or understand a work of art.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.010
Take, for example, William Shakespeare’s
"Macbeth."

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.540
Traditional readings of the text would argue
that an understanding of both Scottish history

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.840
and Shakespeare’s life are fundamental in
understanding the play itself-- how it pays

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.290
homage to King James I, who was king while
it was being written, and how it reflects

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.150
the king’s relationship to the author--King
James was also the patron of Shakespeare’s

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.660
acting company at the time.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.700
But for Barthes, none of this background information
would be pertinent in reading "Macbeth."

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.970
Meaning, to Barthes, lies in the language
of a text itself and whatever impressions

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.350
the reader creates from it.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.340
The Author is less of a God and more of a
mere scriptor.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.540
And according to Barthes’s contemporary Foucault, ”The
work, which once had the duty of providing

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.720
immortality, now possesses the right to kill,
to be its author’s murderer.”

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.700
Does it though?

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.210
French literary theorists in the mid to late
1960’s probably weren’t too concerned

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.290
with pop cultural fanworks and their relation
not only to text, but to authorial intent

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.580
and the author’s body of work, in no small
part because it was not an organized Thing

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.200
in the way it would be only a decade later.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.220
But in discussions of death of the author
and pop culture media, the interaction between

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.330
author and fans is extremely relevant.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.890
Take, for instance, a writer like Anne Rice,
who takes an unusually hardline stance on

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.330
fanworks, especially fan fiction:

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.100
From Rice’s official website: "I do not
allow fan fiction.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.630
The characters are copyrighted.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.230
It upsets me terribly to even think about
fan fiction with my characters.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.220
I advise my readers to write your own original
stories with your own characters.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.770
It is absolutely essential that you respect
my wishes."

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.920
RESPECT THE AUTHOR’S WISHES, FANS.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.940
HOW DARE YOU MAKE THE GAY VAMPIRES EVEN GAYER?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.570
And Rice was not fucking around either. To be in
Anne Rice fandom in the mid-2000’s was to

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.370
play a dangerous game of threats of C&amp;D’s
and of litigation, and the near sum totality

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:27.480
of fanworks relating to the vampire chronicles
existed in locked down private livejournal groups.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.280
I bring up Rice because on some level, she
has a lot in common with "Harry Potter" author,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.200
JK Rowling, but in this one crucial regard,
they are miles apart.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.300
From the onset of Harry Potter’s popularity,
JK Rowling has shown an interest in engaging

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.150
with the fandom and, at most times, been downright
encouraging of fanworks, not limited to fan

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.810
art, fan fiction, fan resource sites, and
other things created by her audience.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.940
Said Rowling’s agent at Christopher Little
Publishing, “JK Rowling's reaction is that

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.150
she is very flattered by the fact there is
such great interest in her Harry Potter series

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.640
and that people take the time to write their
own stories.”

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.080
So, at a surface level, this seems like an
ideal creator-audience relationship: Your

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.510
favorite author is not only fine with you
and your Tumblr friends writing stories about

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.170
her characters, but she’s an open book when
it comes to answering any and all pedantic

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.140
nerd questions you might have about your faves.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.240
What could go wrong with that?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.000
Well largely, it’s the one thing she has
in common with Rice, namely the sense that

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.360
they are masters of the universe that they created
as authors -

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.500
Ever since she joined Twitter, Rowling has
had a tendency to post-scripturally insert

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.631
context, meaning and intent into her text
long after the text has been published, which

00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:39.250
many fans love, but just as many take issue
with.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.730
Not just because of injecting non-textual
intent, but because some of that intent comes

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.920
laden with #implications.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.360
Like, sure, we get that lycanthropy is a stand-in
for disease stigmatization, but Rowling

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:57.860
double-downing on it and then explicitly stating
that it is a wizarding world AIDS analog while

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.820
making one of the main werewolves in the series
essentially a child predator with the explicit

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.080
evil intent of infecting people with his disease
is...

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.400
And then there’s Dumbledore.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.731
At a public reading of the then recently published
last book in the series, "Harry Potter and

00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:23.660
The Deathly Hollows," when a fan asked if Dumbledore
had ever loved anyone, Rowling responded:

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.500
'My truthful answer to you...I always thought
of Dumbledore as gay...

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.020
and that added to his horror when

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.880
Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.920
To an extent, do we say it excused Dumbledore
a little more because falling in love can

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.250
blind us to an extent, but he met someone
as brilliant as he was and, rather like Bellatrix,

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.130
he was very drawn to this brilliant person
and horribly, terribly let down by him.'

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.460
She added: 'Yeah, that's how I always saw
Dumbledore.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.471
And even in 2007, that kind of intent declaration
was already begging the question if representation

00:12:55.471 --> 00:13:00.130
just for representation’s sake, especially
when there is no actual reference in the text

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.910
to Dumbledore’s sexuality, was actually
helpful or if it was just shoehorned tokenizing

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.410
for the sake of staying relevant.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.160
It is, in effect, claiming representation
without having to do any of the work of including

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.740
it in the text, because hey.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.860
Authorial intent.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.940
And yet, after all this, despite multiple opportunities to codify Dumbledore’s

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.190
sexuality into the actual text, she still
hasn’t done it.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.870
Rowling had the opportunity to actually codify
this into later texts, as she is the sole

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.300
credited writer for both Fantastic Beasts
movies, the latter of which touches directly

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.560
on Dumbledore’s angst over his relationship
with Grindelwald but… no homo.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.640
LGBT representation in the Harry Potter-verse
exists only in the paratext, in the authorial

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.770
intent - therefore, according to Barthes,
it does not exist at all.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.420
That said, of course authorial intent influences
fan culture, and inevitably creeps into the

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.740
way people read the text - people take authorial intent
as word of god, and use it to shut down readings

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.760
that conflict with the authorial’s post-scriptural
intent.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.080
And that... kind of sucks.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.660
It’s all well and good - and valid - to
restrict discourse on the Harry Potter series

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.680
to the text itself, and not what the author
says about the text.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:17.220
But here’s the thing - that is neither how
consuming art nor human nature works.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.020
Text is inevitably consumed with paratext
- and paratext influences the way the reader

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.980
interprets the text.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.610
Simply knowing the Discourse around Harry
Potter influences the way you read Harry Potter

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.440
- whether you want it to, or not.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:46.060
In literary theory, paratext refers to materials
supplied by authors, editors, printers and publishers.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.700
This concept has more recently expanded to
anything relating to the text - ranging all

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.250
the way from cultural context to personal brand to size and nature of online platform and, most importantly,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.730
to personal identity.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.390
It’s not that trying to apply Barthes's idea
is invalid, but that given the way culture

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.951
is trending and how the focus on personal
brand and identity is only increasing, even

00:15:07.951 --> 00:15:12.290
an author that tries to let their work speak
for itself can never really die.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:17.240
Foucault was actually way more hardcore than
Barthes--where Barthes stuck to literary theory,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.970
Foucault saw “The Author” as a bigger
problem within a wider system of thought who

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.110
got in the way of The Discourse.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.920
To Foucault, the author is an “ideological
figure” - that people assign meaning to

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.240
the authors text just by virtue of who is
saying it, rather than the meaning inherent

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.280
in the text.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.040
But Foucault considered the decree that the author
has disappeared to be an empty one without

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.830
praxis, and stated that “we must locate
the space left empty by the author’s disappearance,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.810
follow the distribution of gaps and breaches,
and watch for openings this disappearance

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.040
uncovers.”

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.320
In the year of our Lord 2018, we call that
thing ~ * ~ personal brand ~ * ~, and oh your

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.560
precious discourse has indeed been overtaken
by cults of personality 50 years later.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.560
Fifty years later, the work does not possess
the right to kill, to be its authors murderer.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.620
Because the work will always be tied to the
brand, and in the brand lies a certain sort of immortality.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.930
What is Brand can Never Die.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.600
Foucault was a big proponent not only of shedding personal

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.540
identity as it pertained to works, but of all the trappings of identity: “We would no longer hear the questions that

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.920
have been rehashed for so long: Who really
spoke?

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.230
Is it really he and not someone else?

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.720
With what authenticity or originality?

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.000
And what part of his deepest self did he express
in his discourse?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.710
What difference does it make who is speaking?”

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.320
How one person of one gender or of one race
in one time in one place reads "Macbeth" will

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.310
be read way differently than how someone else
in completely different circumstances will

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:56.400
read it. Same with who writes it. And this is a huge shortcoming of Death of the Author in general - it assumes

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.720
that all people from all backgrounds have
equal opportunity - they don’t - and that

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.970
all texts have equal opportunity for exposure
based on merit of the text - they don’t.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.000
In a perfect world, Foucault would be right,
and everyone would have equal opportunity

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.230
and all texts would be judged on their own
merit and not tied to either the author’s

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.860
identity or to their body of work.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.140
But we don’t live in a perfect world, Michel, therefore
Foucault’s ideas and, to a lesser extent

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.060
Barthes's, can really only exist in the world
of pure theory.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.910
Because who tells what story, what their background
is, and why they are telling it - matters

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.280
to readers, and is only mattering more as
time marches on.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.840
If you read "The Fault in our Stars," independent
of any paratext and not reading the author’s

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:51.670
note, all you know about the book is that
it was written by… a man, probably.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.400
That is as pure a reading as you are going
to get.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.050
But of course, this is not the reading most
people had - most people knew the paratext,

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.530
because the author had a platform, and a very
large one.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.040
The author puts on a friendly affect for his
young, largely teenage audience every tuesday.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.160
"Good morning, Hank. It's Tuesday."

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.800
Then you find out that the author was inspired
the write the text in part because of an actual

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.300
human person who lived and died at the age
of 16.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.150
A human person who was also a youtuber, who
the author became friends with, in large part

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.960
because she was his fan.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.000
This is not intent, but it is paratext, and
it does influence the reading of the book.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.100
As the "The Fault in our Stars" blew up in popularity,
so too did the backlash - who are you, John

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.400
Green, to even write this story?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.690
Does it make it more legitimate that he knew
Esther Earl, or does that make it exploitative?

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.880
Is the whole enterprise exploitative?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.400
In the years that followed, as "The Fault in
our Stars" continued to sell incredibly well,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.160
The Discourse began to focus on the author’s
identity, and the trend of so-called

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.310
“sick lit” that the novel helped popularize.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.360
Which is to say nothing of the content of
the novel itself - people started to get upset

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.210
about the fact that Hazel and Augustus share
their first kiss at the Anne Frank house.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.380
And there are sex scenes in this book - what kind
of a grown ass man writes sex scenes between

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.360
two dying teenagers?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.620
What was that?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.660
Oh, shit.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.500
"The Fault in Our Stars" was a 2012 novel written
by me, John Green,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.160
In which, I, John Green, am accidentally a character. Kind of. Which is what this video's about. Sort of.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.340
What inspired, like, this idea that Van Houten was a reflection of you at your ugliest self?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.600
Well, I mean, I think before "The Fault in our Stars" was published, I was interested in

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.980
the questions that I ended up writing about in "The Fault in our Stars."

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.340
Because I'd been asked thousands of times,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.680
what happened to certain characters in my book, "Looking for Alaska."

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.020
And I started to understand that my response to that, my like,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.800
somewhat defensive response to that of, like, I'm not going to tell you. Obviously,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.920
you know, obviously I wanted it to be ambiguous in the story. And I still want it to be ambiguous.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:50.320
I started to understand that that defensiveness that I had was misplaced ultimately.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.400
And so when people ask me the same question about Hazel or about "The Fault in our Stars,"

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.960
I do think of it very differently now. I feel much less defensive. I still don't feel like I have answers for them.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.980
But I understand the question.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.520
I understood that when people read books about people reading books,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.000
they inevitably put the author of the book -- especially if that person was a public figure -- into the story.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.380
Right? Like, I remember being a kid and reading "Catcher in the Rye," and putting

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.640
J.D. Salinger into that story. I couldn't help myself.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.480
I felt like there was no way to write...

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.740
about writing without me being a character in the story in some way.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.440
Like I was writing those parts of the book in 2010/2011. I understood by that time that I had a public life.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:54.680
And, you know, in my own life, when I was a kid, I read books with the authors as characters in them.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.360
I might have even known that I shouldn't, but I couldn't help myself. Like, we live in a perseonality-driven culture.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.620
Even then, we did.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.000
So, this book is called "The Fault in our Stars," and it is dedicated to my friend, Esther

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.680
A lot of people are only going to read John Green books because they have this parasocial relationship with John Green, and

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.920
you know, that's not invalid.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:24.100
I played into it, right? Like, it's not like I tried to avoid having a public life, like...

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.780
I had an email address that they could Google. I had a YouTube channel where they could comment, like...

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:36.840
where did I get off saying that's an inappropriate question to ask this person who has a Twitter?

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:43.940
"I'm gong to a movie with Agustus Waters, I said. Please record the next several episodes of the ANTM marathon for me."

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.380
That's the end of chapter one.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.140
I wonder if there's just something about human nature. There's like, if you

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.080
read someone who tells a fiction, you feel connected to them.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.580
whether you know anything about their lives or not.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:08.120
Yeah, you at least feel a connection to the way that they imagined something, which is intimate in a way.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.800
And I don't know that there's any getting around that.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:22.560
And so the question for me is how do authors interact with stories that they've invented in this time?

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.060
I feel like the idea of death of the author kind of stemmed partially from

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:34.320
this culture that was very absolute, and Bathes kind of wanted to kill absolutes.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.480
But in return, it kind of created a different absolute.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.860
I used to believe that the author should disappear insofar as possible from the text and that the responsibility

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.140
of the reader was to read the text and never think about the author.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.360
You know, like, I had this period in high school where I read everything in the context of the author.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.600
And then I had this long period of maybe 10 or 15 years where I tried to read nothing in the context of the author.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.020
And what I have arrived at at the moment, which I'm sure I will disavow in due time,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:15.200
is that there is no way for the author's brand not to participate in the text if the author has a public life.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.380
Or even if that author doesn't, right? Like J.D. Salinger famously did not have a public life.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:26.900
But he is all over those books. And, like, when people read them, they read them in the context of J.D. Salinger.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.300
And I feel like the absolutes in reading texts creates this problem where you're either constantly guessing

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:41.740
the author's intent, or you're actively trying to divorce yourself everything you know about the world around you and the author.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.260
And I just don't think that's realistic or helpful.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.320
The more you know about my work, the more you know about my friendship with Esther,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.860
the more you see me in that story.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.260
My hope is that the book works if you don't see me in the story.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.220
And I would honestly feel like the book failed if it needed me to be successful.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.300
But at the same time, like, I am definitely aware of the fact that many of the people who read it

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.240
do see me in it. I mean that's why I wrote that like, author's note at the beginning,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:38.240
was I wanted to try to protect insofar as possible--this is a little naive in retrospect--but I wanted to try to protect

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:43.040
the friendships that I'd had that are important to me, that had influenced the story.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.860
I wanted to like, keep them mine? And that proved to be impossible?

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:53.440
And now I read that author's note and I think like, oh, that's quite sweet that that author thought that like...

00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.320
just putting a note in the beginning that says don't read this autobiographically is gonna work

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.960
The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written by John Green ,

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:15.040
in which two children go to great lengths to find out what happens after the ambiguous ending of the protagonist Hazel’s favorite book.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:21.200
The way they do this is to seek out the notoriously reclusive author, and find out the answer from him.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:29.740
But the entire idea is flawed from the getgo - not only does her hero let her down, she does not find her answer, because there is none,

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:38.880
and that is a central theme of the text - sometimes, there is no answer, the universe is chaotic, life is unpredictable and you have no control of when you will die,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.680
and when you die you will not know what becomes of your loved ones.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.380
In seeking out the authorial intent behind a work of fiction, the two leads are trying to gain a sense of control in a chaotic universe,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:27:00.140
the sense that there is indeed an author of sorts to life, as they do not feel that they are the authors of their own stories, that they do not have control over their own fates.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.260
And indeed they do not - but in this case,
letting go of that desire for a sense of control

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.640
is a part of growing up, which ironically,
neither of these characters will get to do.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.350
They must mature into adults while never living
to become adults.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:21.320
This is reflective not only of how we consume
media and the way media can genuinely touch

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.190
and inspire people, but also of a very understandable
and human desire to transform that media.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:32.210
Narratives give us a sense of control in a
world that is generally chaotic and unpredictable.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.790
We need narratives to make sense of the world that we live in.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.450
But that does not mean that we have control
over the narrative.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:43.230
The character arcs of both Hazel and Augustus
are defined by letting go of that desire for

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:49.559
control of their own narratives, and accepting
that life, short though it is, just doesn’t

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.940
work that way, no matter how much they wish
it did.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.400
But that’s just my reading.
