00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:18.142
I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar,
who is a fellow poet.

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.494
And Kaveh found this photo online

00:00:21.518 --> 00:00:25.180
of the anatomical heart of a blue whale

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:29.014
that scientists had hung
on a hook from the ceiling,

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:32.557
which is how they were able to observe
that the heart of a blue whale

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.971
is big enough that a person
can stand up fully inside of it.

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.407
And when Kaveh shared this photo online,

00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:42.581
he did so with the caption,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.228
"This is another reminder

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:51.045
that the universe has already written
the poem you were planning on writing."

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:55.247
And when I first saw that,
I was horrified.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.801
I was like, "Come on, man!
I'm trying to invent new metaphors!

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.763
I'm trying to discover beauty
that hasn't been discovered yet.

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:05.184
What do you mean, the universe
is always going to get there before me?"

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.768
And I know this isn't
a uniquely poet problem,

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:14.024
but on days when the world
feels especially big

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.278
or especially impossible

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:19.321
or especially full of grandeur,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.146
those are the days when I feel,

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:25.733
"What do I possibly have to contribute

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:27.183
to all of this?"

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:31.432
Not long ago, I saw this video
that some of you may have seen.

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:34.394
It makes the internet rounds
every couple of months.

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:36.963
There are these birds
that are called starlings,

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:40.463
and they fly in what's
called a "murmuration,"

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:43.413
which is generally
just a big cloud of birds.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.907
And someone happened to catch
a quick video on their phone

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:50.241
of these starlings flying.

00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:53.417
And at first, it's just an amorphous blob,

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.393
and then there's a moment
where the birds shift,

00:01:56.417 --> 00:02:00.875
and they form the shape of a starling

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.550
in the sky!

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:03.583
(Laughter)

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:05.630
And as soon as I saw it, I was like,

00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:08.057
(Gasps) "The universe has already
written the poem

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.648
you were planning on writing!"

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:10.752
(Laughter)

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.066
Except, for the first time,
it didn't fill me with despair.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.144
Instead, I thought, "OK.

00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:21.909
Maybe it's not my job
to invent something new.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:27.515
Maybe instead it's my job to listen
to what the universe is showing me

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:33.167
and to keep myself open
to what the universe offers,

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.676
so that when it's my turn,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.129
I can hold something to the light,

00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:40.202
just for a moment,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.460
just for as long as I have.

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:48.531
The universe has already written the poem

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:51.772
that you were planning on writing.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.483
And this is why

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:59.259
you can do nothing
but point at the flock of starlings

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:05.408
whose bodies rise and fall
in inherited choreography,

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:09.205
swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.255
that, for one blistering moment,

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.841
forms the unmistakeable shape

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:16.524
of a giant bird

00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:18.710
flapping against the sky.

00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:23.386
It is why your mouth forms an "o"

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.884
that is not a gasp,

00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:27.468
but rather, the beginning of,

00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:30.299
"Oh. Of course."

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:36.412
As in, of course the heart of a blue whale
is as large as a house

00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:40.772
with chambers tall enough
to fit a person standing.

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:44.695
Of course a fig becomes possible

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.246
when a lady wasp lays her eggs
inside a flower,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.185
dies and decomposes,

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.925
the fruit, evidence of her transformation.

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.363
Sometimes, the poem is so bright,

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:02.661
your silly language will not stick to it.

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:06.019
Sometimes, the poem is so true,

00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:08.371
nobody will believe you.

00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:11.098
I am a bird

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:13.840
made of birds.

00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:17.785
This blue heart a house
you can stand up inside of.

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.113
I am dying

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:21.797
here

00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.404
inside this flower.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.895
It is OK.

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.899
It is what I was put here to do.

00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:33.517
Take this fruit.

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:36.200
It is what I have to offer.

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:38.376
It may not be first,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.380
or ever best,

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:42.994
but it is the only way to be sure

00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:45.414
that I lived at all.

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:52.288
(Applause)
