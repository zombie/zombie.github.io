00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.416
Many people face the news each morning

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.896
with trepidation and dread.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.576
Every day, we read of shootings,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.496
inequality, pollution, dictatorship,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.696
war and the spread of nuclear weapons.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.456
These are some of the reasons

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.936
that 2016 was called
the "Worst. Year. Ever."

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.536
Until 2017 claimed that record --

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.616
(Laughter)

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.216
and left many people longing
for earlier decades,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.560
when the world seemed safer,
cleaner and more equal.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.136
But is this a sensible way
to understand the human condition

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.136
in the 21st century?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.936
As Franklin Pierce Adams pointed out,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.656
"Nothing is more responsible
for the good old days

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.896
than a bad memory."

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.656
(Laughter)

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.056
You can always fool yourself
into seeing a decline

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.776
if you compare bleeding
headlines of the present

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.896
with rose-tinted images of the past.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.336
What does the trajectory
of the world look like

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.616
when we measure well-being over time
using a constant yardstick?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.336
Let's compare the most recent
data on the present

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360
with the same measures 30 years ago.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.456
Last year, Americans killed each other
at a rate of 5.3 per hundred thousand,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.856
had seven percent
of their citizens in poverty

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.136
and emitted 21 million tons
of particulate matter

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.256
and four million tons of sulfur dioxide.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.416
But 30 years ago, the homicide rate
was 8.5 per hundred thousand,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.536
poverty rate was 12 percent

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.736
and we emitted 35 million tons
of particulate matter

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.480
and 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.456
What about the world as a whole?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.896
Last year, the world had 12 ongoing wars,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.056
60 autocracies,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.696
10 percent of the world population
in extreme poverty

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.696
and more than 10,000 nuclear weapons.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.216
But 30 years ago, there were 23 wars,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.136
85 autocracies,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.776
37 percent of the world population
in extreme poverty

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.600
and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.735
True, last year was a terrible year
for terrorism in Western Europe,

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.976
with 238 deaths,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.200
but 1988 was worse with 440 deaths.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.976
What's going on?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.496
Was 1988 a particularly bad year?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.576
Or are these improvements a sign
that the world, for all its struggles,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.240
gets better over time?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
Might we even invoke the admittedly
old-fashioned notion of progress?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.176
To do so is to court
a certain amount of derision,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.976
because I have found
that intellectuals hate progress.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.816
(Laughter)

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.656
(Applause)

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.376
And intellectuals who call themselves
progressive really hate progress.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.536
(Laughter)

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.896
Now, it's not that they hate
the fruits of progress, mind you.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.536
Most academics and pundits

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.000
would rather have their surgery
with anesthesia than without it.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.336
It's the idea of progress
that rankles the chattering class.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.096
If you believe that humans
can improve their lot, I have been told,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.496
that means that you have a blind faith

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.096
and a quasi-religious belief
in the outmoded superstition

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.936
and the false promise
of the myth of the onward march

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.000
of inexorable progress.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.976
You are a cheerleader
for vulgar American can-doism,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.216
with the rah-rah spirit
of boardroom ideology,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.296
Silicon Valley
and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.176
You are a practitioner of Whig history,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.336
a naive optimist, a Pollyanna
and, of course, a Pangloss,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.016
alluding to the Voltaire
character who declared,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.376
"All is for the best
in the best of all possible worlds."

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.896
Well, Professor Pangloss,
as it happens, was a pessimist.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.576
A true optimist believes
there can be much better worlds

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.136
than the one we have today.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.816
But all of this is irrelevant,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.616
because the question
of whether progress has taken place

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.376
is not a matter of faith

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.216
or having an optimistic temperament
or seeing the glass as half full.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.080
It's a testable hypothesis.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.096
For all their differences,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.496
people largely agree
on what goes into human well-being:

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.216
life, health, sustenance, prosperity,
peace, freedom, safety, knowledge,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.216
leisure, happiness.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.136
All of these things can be measured.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.496
If they have improved over time,
that, I submit, is progress.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.136
Let's go to the data,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.776
beginning with the most
precious thing of all, life.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.376
For most of human history,
life expectancy at birth was around 30.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.176
Today, worldwide, it is more than 70,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.136
and in the developed parts of the world,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.360
more than 80.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.176
250 years ago, in the richest
countries of the world,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.216
a third of the children
did not live to see their fifth birthday,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.576
before the risk was brought
down a hundredfold.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.856
Today, that fate befalls
less than six percent of children

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.720
in the poorest countries of the world.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.016
Famine is one of the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.296
It could bring devastation
to any part of the world.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.256
Today, famine has been banished

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.880
to the most remote
and war-ravaged regions.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.816
200 years ago, 90 percent
of the world's population

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.016
subsisted in extreme poverty.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.600
Today, fewer than 10 percent of people do.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.216
For most of human history,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.296
the powerful states and empires

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.936
were pretty much always
at war with each other,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.416
and peace was a mere
interlude between wars.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.696
Today, they are never
at war with each other.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.016
The last great power war

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.160
pitted the United States
against China 65 years ago.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.896
More recently, wars of all kinds
have become fewer and less deadly.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.376
The annual rate of war has fallen from
about 22 per hundred thousand per year

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.016
in the early '50s to 1.2 today.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.616
Democracy has suffered obvious setbacks

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.256
in Venezuela, in Russia, in Turkey

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.376
and is threatened by the rise
of authoritarian populism

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.016
in Eastern Europe and the United States.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.736
Yet the world has never been
more democratic

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.736
than it has been in the past decade,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.960
with two-thirds of the world's people
living in democracies.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.416
Homicide rates plunge whenever anarchy
and the code of vendetta

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.816
are replaced by the rule of law.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.056
It happened when feudal Europe was brought
under the control of centralized kingdoms,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.216
so that today a Western European

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.816
has 1/35th the chance of being murdered

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.416
compared to his medieval ancestors.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.896
It happened again in colonial New England,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.456
in the American Wild West
when the sheriffs moved to town,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.176
and in Mexico.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.720
Indeed, we've become safer
in just about every way.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.096
Over the last century,
we've become 96 percent less likely

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.376
to be killed in a car crash,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.336
88 percent less likely
to be mowed down on the sidewalk,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.096
99 percent less likely
to die in a plane crash,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.776
95 percent less likely
to be killed on the job,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.416
89 percent less likely
to be killed by an act of God,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.376
such as a drought, flood,
wildfire, storm, volcano,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.056
landslide, earthquake or meteor strike,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.336
presumably not because God
has become less angry with us

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.096
but because of improvements
in the resilience of our infrastructure.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.376
And what about
the quintessential act of God,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.896
the projectile hurled by Zeus himself?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.160
Yes, we are 97 percent less likely
to be killed by a bolt of lightning.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.136
Before the 17th century,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.696
no more than 15 percent of Europeans
could read or write.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.856
Europe and the United States
achieved universal literacy

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.816
by the middle of the 20th century,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.336
and the rest of the world is catching up.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.776
Today, more than 90 percent
of the world's population

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.240
under the age of 25 can read and write.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.416
In the 19th century, Westerners
worked more than 60 hours per week.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.360
Today, they work fewer than 40.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.856
Thanks to the universal penetration
of running water and electricity

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.256
in the developed world

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.256
and the widespread adoption
of washing machines, vacuum cleaners,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.256
refrigerators, dishwashers,
stoves and microwaves,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.176
the amount of our lives
that we forfeit to housework

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.576
has fallen from 60 hours a week

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.560
to fewer than 15 hours a week.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.296
Do all of these gains in health,
wealth, safety, knowledge and leisure

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.016
make us any happier?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.256
The answer is yes.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.456
In 86 percent of the world's countries,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.840
happiness has increased in recent decades.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.535
Well, I hope to have convinced you

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.976
that progress is not a matter
of faith or optimism,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.135
but is a fact of human history,

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:55.720
indeed the greatest fact in human history.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.296
And how has this fact
been covered in the news?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.480
(Laughter)

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.336
A tabulation of positive and negative
emotion words in news stories

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.016
has shown that during the decades
in which humanity has gotten healthier,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.856
wealthier, wiser, safer and happier,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.976
the "New York Times"
has become increasingly morose

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.600
and the world's broadcasts too
have gotten steadily glummer.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.416
Why don't people appreciate progress?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.416
Part of the answer comes
from our cognitive psychology.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.456
We estimate risk using a mental shortcut
called the "availability heuristic."

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.256
The easier it is to recall
something from memory,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.280
the more probable we judge it to be.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.816
The other part of the answer
comes from the nature of journalism,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.216
captured in this satirical headline
from "The Onion,"

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.296
"CNN Holds Morning Meeting to Decide

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.616
What Viewers Should
Panic About For Rest of Day."

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.336
(Laughter)

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.400
(Applause)

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.976
News is about stuff that happens,
not stuff that doesn't happen.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.376
You never see a journalist who says,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.616
"I'm reporting live from a country
that has been at peace for 40 years,"

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.280
or a city that has not
been attacked by terrorists.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.296
Also, bad things can happen quickly,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.736
but good things aren't built in a day.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.656
The papers could have run the headline,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.056
"137,000 people escaped
from extreme poverty yesterday"

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.936
every day for the last 25 years.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.176
That's one and a quarter billion people
leaving poverty behind,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.216
but you never read about it.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.536
Also, the news capitalizes
on our morbid interest

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.816
in what can go wrong,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.176
captured in the programming policy,
"If it bleeds, it leads."

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.936
Well, if you combine our cognitive biases
with the nature of news,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.656
you can see why the world
has been coming to an end

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.640
for a very long time indeed.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.936
Let me address
some questions about progress

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.320
that no doubt have occurred
to many of you.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.056
First, isn't it good to be pessimistic

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.496
to safeguard against complacency,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.176
to rake the muck, to speak truth to power?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.176
Well, not exactly.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.176
It's good to be accurate.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.656
Of course we should be aware
of suffering and danger

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.096
wherever they occur,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.136
but we should also be aware
of how they can be reduced,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.656
because there are dangers
to indiscriminate pessimism.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.336
One of them is fatalism.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.536
If all our efforts at improving the world

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.856
have been in vain,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.736
why throw good money after bad?

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.332
The poor will always be with you.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.576
And since the world will end soon --

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.456
if climate change doesn't kill us all,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.936
then runaway artificial
intelligence will --

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.576
a natural response is
to enjoy life while we can,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.360
eat, drink and be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.136
The other danger of thoughtless
pessimism is radicalism.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.176
If our institutions are all failing
and beyond hope for reform,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.856
a natural response
is to seek to smash the machine,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.096
drain the swamp,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.896
burn the empire to the ground,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.216
on the hope that whatever
rises out of the ashes

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.480
is bound to be better
than what we have now.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.976
Well, if there is
such a thing as progress,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.256
what causes it?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.456
Progress is not some mystical force
or dialectic lifting us ever higher.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.056
It's not a mysterious arc of history
bending toward justice.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.816
It's the result of human efforts
governed by an idea,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.856
an idea that we associate
with the 18th century Enlightenment,

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.216
namely that if we apply reason and science

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.296
that enhance human well-being,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.960
we can gradually succeed.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.136
Is progress inevitable? Of course not.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.176
Progress does not mean
that everything becomes better

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.136
for everyone everywhere all the time.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.416
That would be a miracle,
and progress is not a miracle

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.640
but problem-solving.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.216
Problems are inevitable

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.920
and solutions create new problems
which have to be solved in their turn.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.456
The unsolved problems
facing the world today are gargantuan,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.256
including the risks of climate change

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.896
and nuclear war,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.456
but we must see them
as problems to be solved,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.896
not apocalypses in waiting,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.176
and aggressively pursue solutions

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.056
like Deep Decarbonization
for climate change

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.280
and Global Zero for nuclear war.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.656
Finally, does the Enlightenment
go against human nature?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.976
This is an acute question for me,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.416
because I'm a prominent advocate
of the existence of human nature,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.856
with all its shortcomings
and perversities.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.296
In my book "The Blank Slate,"

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.456
I argued that the human prospect
is more tragic than utopian

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.216
and that we are not stardust,
we are not golden

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.776
and there's no way
we are getting back to the garden.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.296
(Laughter)

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.616
But my worldview has lightened up

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.576
in the 15 years since
"The Blank Slate" was published.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.536
My acquaintance with
the statistics of human progress,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.896
starting with violence

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.696
but now encompassing
every other aspect of our well-being,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.296
has fortified my belief

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.496
that in understanding
our tribulations and woes,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.296
human nature is the problem,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.656
but human nature, channeled
by Enlightenment norms and institutions,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.880
is also the solution.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.096
Admittedly, it's not easy
to replicate my own data-driven epiphany

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.456
with humanity at large.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.296
Some intellectuals have responded

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.016
with fury to my book "Enlightenment Now,"

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.296
saying first how dare he claim
that intellectuals hate progress,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.456
and second, how dare he claim
that there has been progress.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.160
(Laughter)

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.856
With others, the idea of progress
just leaves them cold.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.576
Saving the lives of billions,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.496
eradicating disease, feeding the hungry,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.960
teaching kids to read?

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.760
Boring.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.216
At the same time, the most common response
I have received from readers is gratitude,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.616
gratitude for changing
their view of the world

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.176
from a numb and helpless fatalism

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.856
to something more constructive,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.616
even heroic.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.816
I believe that the ideals
of the Enlightenment

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.856
can be cast a stirring narrative,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.696
and I hope that people
with greater artistic flare

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.736
and rhetorical power than I

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.776
can tell it better and spread it further.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.240
It goes something like this.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.896
We are born into a pitiless universe,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.096
facing steep odds
against life-enabling order

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.520
and in constant jeopardy of falling apart.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.760
We were shaped by a process
that is ruthlessly competitive.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.496
We are made from crooked timber,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.536
vulnerable to illusions, self-centeredness

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.800
and at times astounding stupidity.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.536
Yet human nature has also
been blessed with resources

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.840
that open a space
for a kind of redemption.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.896
We are endowed with the power
to combine ideas recursively,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.376
to have thoughts about our thoughts.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.296
We have an instinct for language,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.760
allowing us to share the fruits
of our ingenuity and experience.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.416
We are deepened
with the capacity for sympathy,

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.560
for pity, imagination,
compassion, commiseration.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.256
These endowments have found ways
to magnify their own power.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.296
The scope of language has been augmented

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.160
by the written, printed
and electronic word.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.296
Our circle of sympathy has been expanded

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.400
by history, journalism
and the narrative arts.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.016
And our puny rational faculties
have been multiplied

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.736
by the norms and institutions of reason,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.056
intellectual curiosity, open debate,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.776
skepticism of authority and dogma

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.176
and the burden of proof to verify ideas

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.080
by confronting them against reality.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.856
As the spiral of recursive improvement

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.496
gathers momentum,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.056
we eke out victories
against the forces that grind us down,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.336
not least the darker parts
of our own nature.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.096
We penetrate the mysteries
of the cosmos, including life and mind.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.976
We live longer, suffer less, learn more,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.856
get smarter and enjoy more small pleasures

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.200
and rich experiences.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.696
Fewer of us are killed,
assaulted, enslaved, exploited

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.736
or oppressed by the others.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.256
From a few oases, the territories
with peace and prosperity are growing

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.640
and could someday encompass the globe.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.736
Much suffering remains

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.496
and tremendous peril,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.256
but ideas on how to reduce them
have been voiced,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.175
and an infinite number of others
are yet to be conceived.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.616
We will never have a perfect world,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.896
and it would be dangerous to seek one.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.455
But there's no limit
to the betterments we can attain

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.359
if we continue to apply knowledge
to enhance human flourishing.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.896
This heroic story
is not just another myth.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.976
Myths are fictions, but this one is true,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.936
true to the best of our knowledge,
which is the only truth we can have.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.176
As we learn more,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.656
we can show which parts of the story
continue to be true and which ones false,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.480
as any of them might be
and any could become.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.856
And this story belongs not to any tribe

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.736
but to all of humanity,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.456
to any sentient creature
with the power of reason

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.376
and the urge to persist in its being,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.336
for it requires only the convictions

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.536
that life is better than death,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.496
health is better than sickness,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.656
abundance is better than want,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.096
freedom is better than coercion,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.296
happiness is better than suffering

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.720
and knowledge is better
than ignorance and superstition.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.736
Thank you.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.560
(Applause)
