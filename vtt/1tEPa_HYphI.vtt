00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.589
The facts were these.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.479
Pushing Daisies was a genre slurpee that began
airing on October 3, 2007.

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:29.050
The show went on to air for a total of 1 year,
7 months, 4 days, 23 hours, 1 minute and 4

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
seconds.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.760
It was created by Geek Moses and fashion divinity:
Bryan Fuller, notable for his other shows:

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.790
Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, American Gods,
but most probably and most notibly Bryan Fuller

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.949
is known for Hannibal.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:47.640
You see, adult Bryan, aged 17,933 days 6 hours
and 14 minutes, was quite obsessed with death

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.960
in his art.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.949
He wanted to understand it, and his curiosities
were never indulged quite like Pushing Daisies

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.840
– which were not the same death curiosities
that Hannibal exercised—oh my god

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.120
This piece will not contain spoilers, because
I know a lot of people missed this show originally.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.020
If I may, I’m merely gonna sell you on this
wonderful, odd, captivating, beautiful, clever,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.439
quirky, and majestically strange show that
was doomed from day one.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.800
Which sort of means the show was about itself.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.600
Roll the – roll the credits now.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.250
please.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.970
It’s the red button under the green ya...

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.259
Pushing Daisies was a show on ABC that ran
from October 3rd, 2007 to June 13th, 2009

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.810
or two short seasons.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.890
It’s first season was ordered by ABC to
a 13 episode run, before getting upped to

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.040
a full season order (22ish episodes).

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.010
But only 9 episodes were completed before,
never thought I’d say these words out loud

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.610
again: The Writer’s Strike.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.980
Fuller made the most of it and quickly made
the 9th episode of season one the season finale.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.720
So, that’s the way the show was screwed,
the first time.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.140
It gets muddy from there.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.890
But essentially ABC saw ever-declining ratings
as the second season kicked off, so the 13

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.760
written episodes would serve as the only additional
episodes – ABC choosing and announcing to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.620
not even to air the last three of them, but
as the fandom got a little noisy about that,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:59.290
ABC did eventually choose to air them … I
wrote this down, one sec … 10PM on Saturdays.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.390
Screweth, the second and final.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.439
It never got a single full season.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.030
Just, chance.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.549
The entire show idea came from one of Bryan’s
original ideas for an episode of Dead Like

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.200
Me where Grim Reaper George would have trouble
claiming souls because someone was going around

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.409
and touching them all back to life.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.859
Fuller has also cited that the Jean Pierre
Jeunet film Amelie was

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.280
an inspiration which is not hard to see.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.879
Amelie and Pushing Daisies very much have
the same starry-eyed and wondrous view of

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:30.879
the world.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.370
And I like how it ended.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
Abruptly.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.440
Hastily, and not set up.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440
A shock.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.670
Which is how people die in the world of Pushing
Daisies.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.390
It happens without warning and then people
get a hasty minute to sum up their lives and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.040
somehow solve their own demise.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.480
I’m not saying this show couldn’t have
run for 10 glorious seasons, but I am saying

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.489
that it went out on its own terms, kinda literally.

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.000
I’m not saying this fact makes me happy,
but it is kinda fitting.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.280
I’m not sure there’s a fair way to accurately
describe what Pushing Daisies in a single

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.300
sentence that is a) all-encompassing and b)
without a generous helping of semicolons.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.180
So, bottoms up.
No spoilies, promise.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.450
Just talking premise and construction (because
I want everyone to watch and experience this

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.639
stupendous thing).

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.600
Okay, here we go.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.080
Pushing Daisies is an absurdly pristine, storybook
like universe in-which lives one Ned the piemaker,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.860
a man with the ability to revive people with
the touch of a finger but at the expense of

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.340
someone or something nearby generally of the
same brain size—eg.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.770
A revived frog can kill a bird, but not a
human—and he does this to Lonely Tourist

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.669
Charlotte Charles, a person he is madly in
love with, and she him, but Ned can never

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.330
touch someone or something he’s revived
with his skin ever again, lest it die post

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.270
haste, and this time permanently.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.210
I did a bad job, that’s like maybe 10% of
what this show is—I mean, besides a semi-literal

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.780
explanation of a stupendously not literal
show.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.680
Also, there’  s a lot of pie.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.800
“And he became obsessed with pies.”

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.340
The entire show is narrated wonderfully by
Jim Dale.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.389
It is often described as a “forensic fairy
tale,” which I love but also have no idea

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.539
where that phrase was originally coined.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.240
No bother, it’s description is apt.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.280
Pushing Daisies is also a crime procedural
that comments on other crime procedurals,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.750
often involving murder, and often as a means
to get ahead in the world of business.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.260
Like, there’s so many layers going on with
this show and I want nothing more than to

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.860
pull a wonderful pie metaphor out but pies
really don’t have that many layers.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.229
Okay, so Pushing Daisies is a lot like a Taco
Bell 7-layer burrito .. of story.

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:01.190
I think it’s a testament to this show that
it defies description so aptly, not because

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.479
it’s necessarily that hard to start talking
about it, it’s more the fear that you might

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.979
never be able to stop.

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.509
It’s just a big, big thing with twists and
turns in the meta-story while telling more

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.229
personal stories in the episode to episode
continuity – looking and sounding like a

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.270
fairy tale but telling complex relationship
stories in the throws – just pulling one

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.930
of the air – the launch of a car that runs
off dandelions while trying to solve a murder

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.419
of someone who claims to have been killed
by a crash test dummy – confused?

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.310
That’s just one episode.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.520
It’s like that.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.789
Every single episode.

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.960
And I’m still only scratching the surface
to say all that and not talk about the way

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.729
the show handles love.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.410
Which is 100% like a fairy tale.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.289
People fall in love, irreparably forever,
at first sight.

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.340
This happens in every episode—hell it’s
what the show is about.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.350
Two people are gobsmackingly in love and can
never touch skin to skin, forever.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.010
They learn how to navigate an apartment without
the piemaker ending the life of his one true

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.450
love Lonely Tourist Charlotte Charles.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.250
We genuinely watch along as these people try
to figure out a hell of a relationship set

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.250
back.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.090
And I think that’s a beautiful segue into
why this show is so beloved by so many people.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.759
Take everything I’ve just said, and it might
serviceably describe the first three episodes

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:19.759
of the show.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.759
Once it is a little more comfortable in the
fairy tale framing device, it starts exploring

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:29.580
the world and motivations of these characters
at a level that few shows ever do.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.900
It takes purposeful caricatures, like a pair
of retired synchronized swimmers and cheese

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.169
enthusiasts and says, what makes you human?

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:42.889
It has immense depth for such a screwball
high-level conceptual murder procedural experimental

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.139
art comedy.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.660
Hey, there we go.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.009
Nailed the one-sentence descriptor.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.539
[clapping] thank you, thank you.

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:54.000
High five in the whole office.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.909
This show would not be what it is without
the incredible cast.

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:07.480
Chi McBride—or as I like to think of him,
Cyrus from The Frighteners—does incredible

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.340
work as private investigator Emerson Cod.
Lee Pace, even given his stellar track record

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.490
of amazing roles in his career, turns in a
performance that is super easy to empathize

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.490
with.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.560
And Anna Friel, known for being in the 2009
Will Ferrell Saturday morning tv show reboot

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.699
Land of the Lost, needs to be cast in more
awesome things so get on it, Hollywood.

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:34.849
And the Darling Mermaid Darlings Lily and
Vivian played to perfection by Swoosie Kurtz

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:39.550
and Ellen Green, deliver a huge scoop of humanity
to characters that could have easily been

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.600
caricatures.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.970
Plus a guest star list that includes huge
talent in vastly different roles than they’re

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.260
usually cast in.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.540
Hello, Molly Shannon.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.940
These characters are brilliantly written and
brought to life by Fuller, Lisa Joy, Peter

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:08.210
Ocko, Gretchen J. Berg, Aaron Harberts, Abby
Gewanter, Chad Gomez Creasey, Kath Lingenfelter,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:14.520
Scott Nimerfro, Dara Resnik, Jim Danger Gray,
Rina Mimoun, Davey Holmes, and Doug Petrie.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.230
The writing does so much lifting on this show.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.380
If you wanna be a writer this is a good show
to study.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.460
Or the music by Jim Dooley always helping
to always be helping to set an audience’s

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.400
emotional state for the trip down Fairy Tale
lane (not to be confused with Mockingbird

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.570
Lane, Fuller’s one episode reboot of The
Munsters, BUT DID YOU KNOW Jim Dooley also

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.260
scored that).

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.500
The wonderful cinematography by Michael Weaver.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.870
The absolutely unreal set decoration by Halina
Siwolop, art directed by Kenneth J. Creber

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.350
and William J. Durrell Jr.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.960
Outside of the fact that all of the names
I’ve said did incredible work, it’s how

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.220
these parts all fit together so perfectly
that makes this show what it is.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.760
It is a lot more than the sum of its parts.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.080
Ideas this outlandish can have trouble getting
everyone on a show on board the same train

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.400
of thought.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.130
It all just works perfectly in concert.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.130
Which is rare.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.610
It’s one of my favorite shows ever made,
and a lot of it has to do with how engaging

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.920
and affecting these silly stories told in
silly ways still manage to land.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800
It’s got more heart than most, even in light
of a lot of wonky shit happening behind the

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.330
scenes.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.790
It’s a great show to watch with a blanket
and some pie.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.730
Like a pepperoni pie.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.370
It’s a love story about two people who can
never touch.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.190
The dialogue is an artform.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.790
It’s too clever by a mile, got canceled
before its time, and still managed to be one

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.160
of the greatest and more artistically hungry
tv shows to ever exist.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.220
You can watch the whole thing for free, right
now on CW Seed.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.730
There’s a link in the doobly-do.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.900
Go, fall in love with it.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.400
And let me know what you think.
