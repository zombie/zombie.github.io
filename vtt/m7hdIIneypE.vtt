00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.946
This talk contains mature language
Viewer discretion is advised

00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:20.126
Let's get this out of the way.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm here because I wrote
a book about civility,

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:26.718
and because that book came out

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:30.711
right around the 2016
American presidential election,

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:36.387
I started getting lots of invitations
to come and talk about civility

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:40.356
and why we need more of it
in American politics.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.658
So great.

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:46.793
The only problem was that I had written
that book about civility

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:50.936
because I was convinced
that civility is ...

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:53.380
bullshit.

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.452
(Laughter)

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:58.525
Now, that may sound
like a highly uncivil thing to say,

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.017
and lucky for you, and for my publisher,

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.800
I did eventually come to change my mind.

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:05.827
In the course of writing that book

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.510
and studying the long history
of civility and religious tolerance

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:11.264
in the 17th century,

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:16.122
I came to discover
that there is a virtue of civility,

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:20.043
and far from being bullshit,
it's actually absolutely essential,

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:22.124
especially for tolerant societies,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:27.497
so societies like this one,
that promise not only to protect diversity

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:32.387
but also the heated and sometimes
even hateful disagreements

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.036
that that diversity inspires.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.548
You see, the thing about disagreement

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:39.924
is that there is a reason

00:01:39.948 --> 00:01:43.278
that "disagreeable" is a synonym
for "unpleasant."

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:47.195
As the English philosopher
Thomas Hobbes pointed out

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.960
all the way back in 1642,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.904
that's because the mere act
of disagreement is offensive.

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.426
And Hobbes is still right.
It works like this:

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.346
so, if you and I disagree,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.648
and I'm right, because I always am,

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:09.838
how am I to make sense of the fact
that you are so very, very wrong?

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:13.915
It couldn't possibly be that you've just
come to a different conclusion

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.090
in good faith?

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:18.200
No, you must be up to something,
you must be stupid,

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:20.258
bigoted, interested.

00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:21.626
Maybe you're insane.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.616
And the same goes the other way. Right?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.066
So the mere fact
of your disagreeing with me

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.828
is implicitly an insult not only
to my views, but to my intelligence, too.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.232
And things only get worse
when the disagreements at stake

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.193
are the ones that we somehow
consider to be fundamental,

00:02:39.217 --> 00:02:42.642
whether to our worldviews
or to our identities.

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:45.230
You know the kinds of disagreement I mean.

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:47.908
One doesn't discuss religion or politics

00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:52.233
or increasingly, the politics
of popular culture, at the dinner table,

00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:54.002
because these are the disagreements,

00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:57.488
these are the things that people
really, seriously disagree about,

00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:02.627
and they define themselves against
their opponents in the controversy.

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:06.694
But of course
those fundamental disagreements

00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:09.660
are precisely the ones
that tolerant societies

00:03:09.684 --> 00:03:13.395
like the United States
propose to tolerate,

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.061
which perhaps explains why,
historically, at least,

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:21.697
tolerant societies haven't been
the happy-clappy communities of difference

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.625
that you sometimes hear about.

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:28.225
No, they tend to be places
where people have to hold their noses

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.535
and rub along together
despite their mutual contempt.

00:03:32.282 --> 00:03:34.924
That's what I learned
from studying religious tolerance

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.497
in early modern England and America.

00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:40.791
And I also learned
that the virtue that makes

00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:46.679
that un-murderous coexistence,
if you will, possible,

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:48.624
is the virtue of civility,

00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:53.077
because civility makes
our disagreements tolerable

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:59.921
so that we can share a life together
even if we don't share a faith --

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:02.183
religious, political or otherwise.

00:04:03.838 --> 00:04:06.902
Still, I couldn't help but notice

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:09.950
that when most people
talk about civility today --

00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:12.895
and boy, do they talk
about civility a lot --

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.918
they seem to have something else in mind.

00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:19.292
So if civility is the virtue that makes it
possible to tolerate disagreement

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:22.332
so that we can actually
engage with our opponents,

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:24.031
talking about civility

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.015
seems to be mainly
a strategy of disengagement.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:31.300
It's a little bit like threatening
to take your ball and go home

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:33.886
when the game isn't going your way.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.999
Because the funny thing about incivility

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:39.546
is that it's always
the sin of our opponents.

00:04:40.044 --> 00:04:41.404
It's funny.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.289
When it comes to our own bad behavior,

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:46.770
well, we seem to develop
sudden-onset amnesia,

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:51.921
or we can always justify it
as an appropriate response

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.747
to the latest outrage from our opponents.

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:59.240
So, "How can I be civil to someone
who is set out to destroy

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:00.831
everything I stand for?

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:02.533
And by the way, they started it."

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:05.121
It's all terrifically convenient.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.454
Also convenient is the fact
that most of today's big civility talkers

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.903
tend to be quite vague and fuzzy

00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:17.924
when it comes to what they think
civility actually entails.

00:05:17.948 --> 00:05:22.136
We're told that civility
is simply a synonym for respect,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.114
for good manners, for politeness,

00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:30.157
but at the same time, it's clear
that to accuse someone of incivility

00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:34.110
is much, much worse
than calling them impolite,

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:39.457
because to be uncivil
is to be potentially intolerable

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:42.537
in a way that merely being rude isn't.

00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:46.569
So to call someone uncivil,
to accuse them of incivility,

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:51.220
is a way of communicating
that they are somehow beyond the pale,

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:53.617
that they're not worth
engaging with at all.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.066
So here's the thing:

00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:00.541
civility isn't bullshit,

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:05.482
it's precious because it's the virtue
that makes fundamental disagreement

00:06:06.554 --> 00:06:09.482
not only possible but even
sometimes occasionally productive.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:13.292
It's precious, but it's also
really, really difficult.

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.694
Civility talk, on the other hand,

00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:20.575
well, that's really easy,

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:21.983
really easy,

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.515
and it also is almost always
complete bullshit,

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.292
which makes things slightly awkward for me

00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:32.466
as I continue to talk to you
about civility.

00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:34.777
(Laughter)

00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:38.389
Anyway, we tend to forget it,

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:41.940
but politicians and intellectuals
have been warning us for decades now

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:44.560
that the United States
is facing a crisis of civility,

00:06:44.584 --> 00:06:47.906
and they've tended to blame that crisis
on technological developments,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.978
on things like cable TV,
talk radio, social media.

00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:53.547
But any historian will tell you

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.920
that there never was a golden age
of disagreement,

00:06:55.944 --> 00:06:57.470
let alone good feelings,

00:06:57.494 --> 00:06:59.328
not in American politics.

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.893
In my book, though, I argue
that the first modern crisis of civility

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:05.737
actually began about 500 years ago,

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:09.386
when a certain professor of theology
named Martin Luther

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.101
took advantage of a recent advancement
in communications technology,

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.379
the printing press,

00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:17.569
to call the Pope the Antichrist,

00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:22.150
and thus inadvertently launch
the Protestant Reformation.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:26.459
So think of the press, if you will,
as the Twitter of the 16th century,

00:07:26.483 --> 00:07:29.063
and Martin Luther as the original troll.

00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:31.232
And I'm not exaggerating here.

00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:34.606
He once declared himself unable to pray

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.765
without at the same time cursing

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.147
his "anti-Christian,"
i.e. Catholic, opponents.

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:43.089
And of course, those Catholic opponents
clutched their pearls

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:44.798
and called for civility then, too,

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:47.132
but all the while,
they gave as good as they got

00:07:47.156 --> 00:07:48.998
with traditional slurs like "heretic,"

00:07:49.022 --> 00:07:51.259
and, worst of all, "Protestant,"

00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:55.301
which began in the 16th century
as an insult.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:00.500
The thing about
civility talk, then as now,

00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:05.501
was that you could call out
your opponent for going low,

00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:07.772
and then take advantage
of the moral high ground

00:08:07.796 --> 00:08:10.144
to go as low or lower,

00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:12.436
because calling for civility
sets up the speaker

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.247
as a model of decorum
while implicitly, subtly stigmatizing

00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:19.215
anyone with the temerity
to disagree as uncivil.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:24.965
And so civility talk in the 17th century
becomes a really effective way

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.125
for members of the religious establishment

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:32.396
to silence, suppress, exclude dissenters
outside of the established church,

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.305
especially when they spoke out
against the status quo.

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:37.705
So Anglican ministers
could lecture atheists

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:40.076
on the offensiveness of their discourse.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.426
Everyone could complain about the Quakers

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.617
for refusing to doff and don their hats

00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:47.696
or their "uncouth" practice
of shaking hands.

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:50.816
But those accusations of incivility

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.704
pretty soon became
pretexts for persecution.

00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:57.088
So far, so familiar, right?

00:08:57.112 --> 00:08:59.675
We see that strategy again and again.

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:04.778
It's used to silence civil rights
protesters in the 20th century.

00:09:04.802 --> 00:09:08.914
And I think it explains
why partisans on both sides of the aisle

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:11.548
keep reaching for this,
frankly, antiquated,

00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:14.232
early modern language of civility

00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:18.457
precisely when they want to communicate
that certain people and certain views

00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:20.574
are beyond the pale,

00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:22.717
but they want to save
themselves the trouble

00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.043
of actually making an argument.

00:09:25.067 --> 00:09:28.535
So no wonder skeptics like me
tend to roll our eyes

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:31.306
when the calls for
conversational virtue begin,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.274
because instead of healing
our social and political divisions,

00:09:34.298 --> 00:09:37.789
it seems like so much civility talk
is actually making the problem worse.

00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:41.234
It's saving us the trouble
of actually speaking to each other,

00:09:41.258 --> 00:09:45.195
allowing us to speak
past each other or at each other

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.614
while signaling our superior virtue

00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:50.163
and letting the audience know
which side we're on.

00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:55.516
And given this, I think
one might be forgiven, as I did,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.699
for assuming that because
so much civility talk is bullshit,

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.691
well then, the virtue of civility
must be bullshit, too.

00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:06.400
But here, again, I think a little
historical perspective goes a long way.

00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:09.831
Because remember, the same
early modern crisis of civility

00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:11.814
that launched the Reformation

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:14.599
also gave birth to tolerant societies,

00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:17.298
places like Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,

00:10:17.322 --> 00:10:19.942
and indeed, eventually the United States,

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:24.831
places that at least aspired
to protect disagreement

00:10:24.855 --> 00:10:26.632
as well as diversity,

00:10:27.997 --> 00:10:33.377
and what made that possible
was the virtue of civility.

00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:35.124
What made disagreement tolerable,

00:10:35.148 --> 00:10:38.065
what it made it possible
for us to share a life,

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:40.469
even when we didn't share a faith,

00:10:40.493 --> 00:10:42.303
was a virtue,

00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:45.557
but one, I think,
that is perhaps less aspirational

00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:47.510
and a lot more confrontational

00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:51.169
than the one that people
who talk about civility a lot today

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:52.495
tend to have in mind.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:56.153
So I like to call that virtue
"mere civility."

00:10:57.288 --> 00:11:01.138
You may know it as the virtue
that allows us to get through

00:11:01.162 --> 00:11:03.598
our relations with an ex-spouse,

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.130
or a bad neighbor,

00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:07.455
not to mention a member
of the other party.

00:11:07.973 --> 00:11:13.206
Because to be merely civil
is to meet a low bar grudgingly,

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:15.965
and that, again, makes sense,

00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:19.672
because civility is a virtue
that's meant to help us disagree,

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:22.711
and as Hobbes told us
all those centuries ago,

00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:26.512
disagreeable means unpleasant
for a reason.

00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:33.586
But if it isn't bullshit,
what exactly is civility or mere civility?

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.760
What does it require?

00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:40.036
Well, to start, it is not and cannot be

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.734
the same thing
as being respectful or polite,

00:11:43.758 --> 00:11:47.124
because we need civility precisely
when we're dealing with those people

00:11:47.148 --> 00:11:51.719
that we find it the most difficult,
or maybe even impossible, to respect.

00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:55.513
Similarly, being civil
can't be the same as being nice,

00:11:55.537 --> 00:12:01.680
because being nice means not telling
people what you really think about them

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:04.235
or their wrong, wrong views.

00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:08.702
No, being civil means speaking your mind,

00:12:10.008 --> 00:12:13.389
but to your opponent's face,

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:15.317
not behind her back.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.797
Being merely civil
means not pulling our punches,

00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:24.601
but at the same time, it means maybe
not landing all those punches all at once,

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.106
because the point of mere civility

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.212
is to allow us to disagree,
to disagree fundamentally,

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:37.760
but to do so without denying or destroying
the possibility of a common life tomorrow

00:12:37.784 --> 00:12:41.601
with the people that we think
are standing in our way today.

00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:45.872
And in that sense, I think
civility is actually closely related

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:48.205
to another virtue, the virtue of courage.

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:54.618
So mere civility is having the courage
to make yourself disagreeable,

00:12:54.642 --> 00:12:56.515
and to stay that way,

00:12:56.539 --> 00:13:00.038
but to do so while staying in the room

00:13:00.062 --> 00:13:02.784
and staying present to your opponents.

00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:08.428
And it also means that, sometimes,
calling bullshit on people's civility talk

00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:10.617
is really the only civil thing to do.

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:12.950
At least that's what I think.

00:13:13.934 --> 00:13:18.006
But look, if I've learned anything
from studying the long history

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.887
of religious tolerance
in the 17th century, it's this:

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:26.769
if you're talking about civility
as a way to avoid an argument,

00:13:26.793 --> 00:13:30.721
to isolate yourself
in the more agreeable company

00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:33.187
of the like-minded
who already agree with you,

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:38.132
if you find yourself
never actually speaking to anyone

00:13:38.156 --> 00:13:42.639
who really, truly, fundamentally
disagrees with you,

00:13:42.663 --> 00:13:45.583
well, you're doing civility wrong.

00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:48.242
Thank you.

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:52.492
(Applause)
