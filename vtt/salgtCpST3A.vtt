00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Good Morning John,
We had a great chat on the phone this week.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.320
And I want to hit you with insights that
I feel like we have, we know, and we

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.320
talk about together. And we have
almost developed together over the years.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.320
But I don’t know that we talk about it like--
each one of these led to the next.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.920
And I think it’s useful. It’s been useful for me,
I think, but it’s hard to tell for sure.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.640
Number 1, it is really hard, maybe impossible,
to stop wanting things. But also, is it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.560
actually good to not want anything.
Like I want to want to live. I want to want to

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.000
make a better future for people. I don’t really
want to want a new car. But I do want to

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.680
want to spend time with my family.
So insight #1 is you can’t stop wanting,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.480
and I’m not sure that I want to. Which leads
directly to insight #2, which is but maybe

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.560
you can help steer what you want.
This maybe is better stated as

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.040
“it is hard to control what you want.”
Like, you can’t do it through sheer

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.280
force of will, I can’t just say, “I want to stop
wanting Coca Cola, and I want to start

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.560
wanting to volunteer all the time.”
That’s what I want to want.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.440
But I don’t want that. I want to drink
Coca Cola and watch Tik Toks.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.560
But I have found there are things that
I can do to alter my wants.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320
Like if I want to work more on Crash Couse,
I have to think about education.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
I have to listen to education podcasts,
and talk to people who are thinking hard

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.560
about how to make college more accessible.
The more time I spend engaging with those

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.920
questions, the more I actually want to do it.
And if I want to spend more time with

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.760
my family, I have to spend more time with
my family. Like, the more I do it the more

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.000
I want to do it. Because the more I do
it I’m teaching myself a story about the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.560
value of those things. What I actually see
really often is people engaging with certain

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.600
kinds of content and not noticing how
it steers their wants. Like the content is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.720
enjoyable, no doubt about that. But what
is it doing to my wants? Like there are a

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.240
lot of people who consume content about
how to be successful in business and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.400
get rich. And when you consume that
content, you value being successful

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.880
in business and getting rich more.
And the more people who spend time

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.840
watching people play video games
professionally, the more people start to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.240
value those particular skills, of professional
video game playing. And there are a lot of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.200
people who engage with content about
how to be more beautiful. And the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
more you engage with that content,
the more you value beauty.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Now this is just one of the ways that
you increase your want in something.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.320
There’s two other big ones.
One is... it is good. It’s good to have money.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.308
There is security there. 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.280
Playing video games is fun. Fashion
and makeup are art. And the second reason

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.240
is that we live in a society where these
things are really highly praised.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.920
The barrier to wanting these things
is low, so we are more likely to be

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.800
interested in consuming that kind
of content. And I don’t think it’s wrong

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.520
to want these things, I do think it can be
limiting if it’s the only thing we allow

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.640
ourselves to want. Can we either
ignore those wants completely if we’re

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.440
not interested in them, or diversify from there?
And this is hard, because the barrier to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.400
wanting something gets a lot higher when
society prizes it less. The less you engage

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.560
with a story, the harder it is to want that thing.
And if there aren’t a lot of stories about

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.840
that thing, it becomes really to want it.
And in a way, this means that the most

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.320
successful people in our society are kind of
the least interesting. They’re just really

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.400
good at going after the default thing that
society is telling them to want.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.600
Sometimes those people can become&nbsp;

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600
stories themselves that&nbsp;
alter societal wants overall.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.240
But usually not. Which is all a way of
saying that if you prize just a little bit of

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.960
interesting or weird, if that’s the story you’re
into, which I am, then that’s like a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.760
baseline story that you can always believe
in that prevents you from getting stuck

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.120
in these societal ruts. Not that I’m always
great at it. It’s very easy to get stuck

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.840
in there and very hard for me to steer
my not insubstantial want. But I’m going

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.800
to keep trying. Because I feel like I’m
getting better at it. And I feel like the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.080
results are positive. John, I’ll
see you on Tuesday.
