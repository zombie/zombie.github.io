00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.870
the problem is i think post-modernism

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.400
has to a large extent run its course

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.920
David Foster Wallace is known for being

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.230
one of the most influential writers in

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.330
recent history before taking his own

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
life in 2008 he decried the negative

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.280
effects post-modernism had on his

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.949
generation post-modernism is a very

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.109
wide-ranging term used to analyze our

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.640
world that emerged in the nineteen

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.980
fifties and sixties it rejected the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.779
grand narratives that exists in

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.759
modernism things like there's one true

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.189
God history is progress and peace on

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.770
earth in postmodern thought there is no

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.140
scientific philosophical or religious

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.149
truth which will explain everything for

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.989
everybody

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.239
it lacks that optimism instead

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.399
everything is understood on a micro

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.530
level knowledge and truth are contextual

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.780
and constructed reality only comes into

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.610
existence through our interpretations of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.020
what the world needs to us individually

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.719
thus post-modernism is characterized by

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.699
self-referential ality such as a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.620
character who knows their character in a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620
novel or film by moral relativism and by

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.290
cynicism and irony with that in mind

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.350
here's Wallace again that the problem

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.730
though is now is that a lot of the

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.490
sticks of post-modernism irony cynicism

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
irreverence are now part of whatever it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.020
is that's enervating in the culture

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.980
itself right

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.720
Wallace's biggest concern was with the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.150
dominant cultural force of television

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.680
which he believed had become too

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.570
saturated with these postmodern

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.630
characteristics TVs response to dumb and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.120
overly sentimental sitcoms was ironing

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.400
TV shows began criticizing themselves

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.650
for being dumb TV shows can't be

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.480
happening we have to see this movie dude

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.250
is great about the isn't that good

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.720
anyway and then what are you talking

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.670
about love carrots in film and animation

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100
up crabby

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.310
it's hard to criticize a show that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.770
criticizes itself first shows became

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.299
more self-referential and

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.470
self-deprecating

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.049
in short they took nothing seriously and

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.090
there's a problem with this in Wallace's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.210
mind irony has no redemptive qualities

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.220
in and of itself it can point out

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.680
problems and deconstruct things but it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.450
offers no solution

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.280
it's like a rebel to throwing a tyrant

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.770
only to become a better tyrant

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.660
take for example seinfeld ironic

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.910
critique of the sitcom every character

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.700
is very human problems are laid bare but

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.489
they're presented as unsolvable whereas

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.739
earlier more sugary sitcoms might offer

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.870
a solution through family friends or

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.450
hobbies seinfeld gives you nothing

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.730
that's not a redeeming formula it's a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.310
cynical one family guys use of irony is

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.470
slightly different but no more redeeming

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.630
it makes ironic connections to history

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.850
celebrity stereotypes you name it he

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.319
cares more about the number of

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.910
connections that can make rather than

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.220
providing any lessons or challenging any

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.690
principles with them

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.120
it simply uses irony to reassure us of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.799
our knowledge of cultural discourse

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.750
you've got saturday night lives

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.850
deconstruction of cynicism arrested

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.980
development superficial relationships

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.570
it's always sunny is irredeemable

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.359
characters and in Wallace's time all of

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.670
these shows the ironic mode shows up in

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.130
advertising all the time here 20 ads

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.650
making fun of themselves for being ads

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.109
hello I'm an actor I've been paid eight

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.209
thousand dollars to tell you how great

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.340
nor net is compared to other banks to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.280
Wallace TVs unabashed self-deprecation

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.980
and deconstruction of our culture the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.739
idea that everything is fabricated was

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.170
corrosive to the soul hip cynical

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.299
transcendence of sentiment is really

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.269
some kind of fear of being really human

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.070
he thought we'd find a solution in

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.680
shifting televisions overall tone away

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.380
from one of cynical irony to one of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.480
sincerity and no doubt this terminal

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.459
shift is occurring in some spheres of

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.350
pop culture and has been for the last

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.720
decade it's due in part to david foster

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.060
wallace himself and likely to a general

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.370
cultural shift away from cynicism in

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.229
general it's interesting to see how this

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.540
total shift has affected TV comedies

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.250
some of comedies greatest tools are

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.840
characteristically post

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.510
so how these combined with sincerity to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.640
change American humor

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.680
it all starts in $MONTH 2006 with the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.230
office then in $MONTH 2009 the tonal

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.060
shift towards sincerity continued with

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.190
community modern family and Parks and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.410
Recreation they all have similarities to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.480
the postmodern predecessors but instead

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.430
of the blank parody of family guide the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.169
superficiality of arrested development

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.620
or the cynicism of seinfeld they have a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.130
heart

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.690
they have redeeming characters who have

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.090
a sincere yearning for meaning and human

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.900
connection

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.970
the office is full of redemptive people

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.310
looking for human affirmation any

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.740
ironing the show is balanced with Ernest

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.030
sentimentality

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.919
take for example Jim and Pam's romantic

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.200
chemistry their connection relies on a

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.419
hyper awareness and mutual ironic

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.280
detachment from the office

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.919
it's not just irony for irony sake it

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.750
has that addition of a sincere human

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.340
relationship attached to it

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.470
indeed rarely does the show use irony at

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.810
the expense of a character ever in one

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.910
episode a recently dumped and he tries

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.250
to talk jimmy out of being with Pam and

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.479
Jim response to him

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.840
ironically so scared all right things

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.180
are going on and you're coming out with

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.000
almost no knowledge of course adjuster

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.960
opinion on this

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.090
Andy Reid's Jim's ironic comment as

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.190
sincere and for the rest of the day

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.800
believes he's genuinely taking on all of

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.780
jim's emotional troubles even though

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.370
Jim's perfectly happy with his

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.960
relationship at the end of the episode

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.599
one of andy's co-workers reveals the

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.910
joke i think Jim is messing with you but

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.160
instead of judging or belittling Andy

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.680
for the postmodern crime of being naive

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.479
in the face of irony

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.880
Jim uses the occasion to teach Andy a

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.310
sincere lesson that's not that Apple you

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.650
and angela is a bummer and I know that

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.460
you don't think you're going to find

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.950
someone else but you will I promise you

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.150
you will

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.010
Jim's ironic stance ends with in

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.660
delivering a sentiment upholding

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.330
American romantic ideals much like the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.460
office community balances it's pop

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.440
culture references and ironic moments

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.240
with characters who sincerely desire

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.460
human connection the title of the show

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.020
tells us this out right

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.820
it's about how and why we come together

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.039
and form communities with other people

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.510
and even when it parodies and

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.289
deconstructs tvtropes like the jock it

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.629
so in an uplifting way turning the

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.430
all-star quarterback into one of the

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.649
most caring people on the show and

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.689
despite its frequent cynicism community

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:18.819
tells us that no matter how isolated and

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.770
alone you may think you are we need

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.360
other people around us in order to

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.259
function

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.699
it doesn't matter if it's a bunch of

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.860
outcasts they can still come together

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.569
through their shared similarities in the

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.610
ways they conflict with each other as

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.189
well the show at its core believes in

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.349
common human dignity and communal

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:36.279
integrity

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.800
it's a sincere anti nihilistic message

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.379
you won't get from these shows then

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.119
there's parks and recreation which

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:45.009
contains very few postmodern

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.899
characteristics you won't find the show

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.059
making fun of itself there's no meta

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.689
humor

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:51.999
it avoids a cynical tone entirely

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.830
ultimately it's a show about good people

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.959
trying to do good things

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.789
Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson have an

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.309
entirely different idea of civic duty

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:02.110
you have the hope and naiveté of

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.209
government and body then Leslie and the

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:05.949
pessimism and deconstruction of

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.930
government embodied in wrong

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.789
this relationship is right for a sort of

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:12.309
seinfeld and resentment and cynicism but

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:14.409
rotten Leslie have a mutual respect for

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:15.819
each other and they have a good

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:16.689
friendship

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.399
both are awesome both are flawed and the

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.870
show constantly goes back and forth

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.969
between them without taking the side

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:24.309
Andy and April are very similar both are

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.319
great but one is ultra sincere and the

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.509
other cynical we see every characters

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:30.879
ideology but never fully embrace or

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.189
discredit their stance sure the show is

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:35.080
about bureaucratic conflict but it's

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.909
also about how disparate people in a

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:39.610
town connect the show's overall tone

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.259
that cynical thinking isn't the smartest

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:44.110
or coolest makes a dramatic shift away

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.180
from post-modernism this wave of

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.849
earnestness and TV comedy shows no sign

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:50.860
of slowing down part of the reason jon

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.899
stewart was successful for so long was

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.399
that he had an unwavering sincerity

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.249
behind the irony in the daily shell two

00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:59.589
of his major successors understand that

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:01.779
balance the best shows of our age aren't

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.490
finding the humor in the gaps that have

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.709
developed between people they find the

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.990
humor in the absurd and awkward attempts

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.149
by people trying to bridge those gaps

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.519
they want to show us that humans can

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.349
have real connections and sincerity for

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:17.050
each other it's not impossible it's just

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.779
really fucking hard postmodern thought

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:21.569
with its deconstruction of every

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:23.550
thing in its emphasis on individual

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.889
interpretation leads us down a road of

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.860
narcissism cynicism and detachment to

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.599
fix it we need not appeal to something

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:32.940
as abstract or dangerous as the grand

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.370
narratives of modernism to feel less

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.800
lonely it's perhaps this non-ideological

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.860
pursuit of getting along of striving to

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.289
have strong communal integrity valuing

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.339
others for their human dignity

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:47.310
unabashedly enjoying the things we find

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.560
to be awesome and as David Foster

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.839
Wallace would say making it ok to be

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.810
unavoidably sentimental and naive and

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.600
grown and generally pathetic that might

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.610
help us find a greater sense of meaning

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.680
and optimism in our lives

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.029
these shows tell us that strict

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.009
adherence to cynicism isn't all that

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:07.800
smart or cool and that perhaps we learn

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.839
more about what it means to be human

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.910
by embracing life and the different

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.550
people around us everyone thank you so

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.410
much for watching I had an absolute

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.170
blast making that video I don't always

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.579

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.889
the quality as high as possible on my

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:30.600
