00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.980
From the standpoint of human geography,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.740
why we live where we live in the world,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.500
it's actually driven by a fairly
categorically organized set of variables.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.540
Those variables are colliding,
but you can actually segment them.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.180
Demographic imbalances:
the gap between young and old.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.460
Young people move to countries
where wealthy aging populations need them.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.340
That's been happening for generations.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.100
Political upheaval: civil wars,
international conflicts,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.860
such as we're witnessing right now,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.660
but of course, the 20th century
had a lot of these as well.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.020
So large refugee flows, for example.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.380
Economic dislocation,
like financial crises,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.180
when we have those people
move away from areas

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.420
that have become
deindustrialized, for example,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
like the Rust Belt of the United States
or Southern Europe.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.700
Technological disruption.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.860
That can be AI and automation,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.660
forcing you away from the place
where you had a stable job.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.060
But it could also mean Zoom.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.020
You can live anywhere, do this call,
do your job from anywhere.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.340
So positive and negative.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.820
And of course, climate change,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.780
which is actually the original
driver of where we live,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.260
and it's coming back.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.460
It was the driver of where
humans have settled

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.860
for hundreds of thousands of years,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.220
and now it's changing.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.980
And if you take all of these together
and multiply it by the connectivity,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.300
all of the infrastructure that we have
built to enable human mobility,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.420
you get a world in which we’re going
to use that capacity for mobility,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.340
and we're going to have mass migrations

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.620
potentially on a scale
we've never seen before.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.420
And that's what I want to dive
into a little bit right now.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.300
So let's start with the climate angle.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.940
This map actually shows you the present
distribution of the world population.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.700
This is it, all of us, you,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.300
wherever you are,
you are a pixel on this map.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.820
There's eight billion pixels here.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.460
Now, watch what happens, tragically,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380
as climate change advances

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.460
and as what is called
the suitability of a geography changes,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.660
in other words, the suitability
for human habitation and survivability.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.300
Now, what you just saw happen
is an animation

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.980
that reflects what’s called
the Suitability Index,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.620
derived from measurements
of temperature change.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.540
There's obviously many other
climate-related factors as well,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460
rising sea levels, among others.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740
But this is strictly based
upon temperature.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.940
And red doesn't mean
you cannot live there,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.980
but it means that it's becoming
decreasingly suitable for human life,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.780
whereas green means that relative
to how it used to be,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.140
it's becoming more suitable
for human life.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.060
Now, this is the greatest irony
in the entire world today.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.700
I can think of no more profound paradox
that we've ever encountered than this.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.140
Think about what I showed you before.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
Most of the human population
lives in places

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.220
that are basically turning red.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.700
The places that are green
right now on your map

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.020
are places that are depopulating.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.100
Less and less people

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.860
as a result of old age and mortality
and low fertility rates.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.820
So the rich countries of the world,
the United States, Canada,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.740
Europe and so forth, Russia, Japan
would actually be declining in population,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.340
Russia most certainly is,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.700
were it not for immigration.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.380
This is what we have to solve.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.140
This is the profound challenge.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.340
In one picture
that's worth millions of words,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.660
this is the world that we seem
to be headed towards.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.020
We need to figure out how eight billion
people reside on this landmass.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.860
The territorial area on this map
is 150 million square kilometers.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.340
There are eight billion of us.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.940
Where do we go to optimize
our own survival as a species?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.740
And because of the lines that are missing
on this map, the borders,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.380
this becomes a lot more difficult

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.460
than it would be if we could simply wander
wherever we wanted to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.740
the way we did when we were
populating the continents

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.620
over the last 100,000 years.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.940
Now, over the last 30 years,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.100
this has been a stable migration
arrangement in the world.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.100
The largest number of people
moving within and across regions

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.980
is documented for you here.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.500
And it's people within
the former Soviet republics,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.540
so Ukrainians to Russia,
Russians to Ukraine.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.500
Now Ukrainians out of both
Russia and Ukraine.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.780
South Asians moving
to the Persian Gulf countries.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.060
Latin Americans moving north
into Central and North America.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.060
Europeans within Europe and so on.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.020
This is what’s been steady flows,
if you will, of people

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.460
over the last 30 years.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.980
But the next 30 years
won't be exactly the same.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.380
And that we, again, don't have a map for,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.900
there isn't even really
a historical precedent

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.700
for that kind of movement across regions,
across continents, as we might see.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.060
Now, the second demographic factor here is

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.820
our overall world population.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.140
All of this is happening at a time when,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.460
instead of the world
reaching 15 billion people,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.580
as some predicted in the 1980s and 1990s,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.020
instead it could well be
that our world population

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.940
never even reaches 10 billion people.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.540
So I call it peak humanity.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.220
Fertility is declining.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.980
Again, note the mismatch.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.900
The wealthy countries of the north

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.420
are the ones that are
shrinking in population,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.540
whereas young countries of the South
and the developing world

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.900
still have very large, young populations.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.340
And we need to find ways
to correct that mismatch

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.900
if we want to have a global population
that is sort of, you know,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.900
stable and willing to reproduce.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.180
Not that we want
to have a population surge,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.340
but we don't want to crash either.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.140
We need to think about how young people
can cope with climate, with geopolitics,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.500
with the economic pressure,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.380
and live in places
where they can still produce

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.500
a sizeable next generation of people.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.860
What's happening right now

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.340
is that young people
aren't having any children.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.420
And that's going to actually lead

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.180
to a very steep
population crash in many ways.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.180
So this got me thinking
about how young people think.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.100
And this forms a big part
of the argument of the "Move" book,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.460
because when we, and I don't mean
we as in every one of you,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.580
but when people who are say,
my age or older, Gen X or,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.140
you know, baby boomers,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.340
we speak very confidently in this sort of,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.620
you know, plural pronoun,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.900
you know, as if our views represent
the views of people in the world.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.460
Young people in cities who don’t have
children who are struggling,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.740
that’s the future of humanity.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.100
It’s the present
and the future of humanity.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.700
And I'm interested
in the things that we can do

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.620
to make life better for those people,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.060
because they are the present
and the future

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.220
of our species' population.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.140
And they do think very differently
from previous generations.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.020
They're not loyal to nationality,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.660
they're more interested
in certain sets of values.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.180
And those values, that have been
very well documented,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.980
are the right to connectivity,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.980
a sustainable world and mobility,
their own right to be mobile.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.580
In fact, this is the most mobile
generation in the history of the world,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.260
because not only do we have the tools,
the physical infrastructure to do it.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.860
But again, the things that have pinned
people down primarily

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.900
are home ownership and having children.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.780
But if people don't own homes
and don't have children,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.860
then they are by definition quite mobile,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.620
especially if they're not even
loyal to their home country

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.020
for the sake of it.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.100
And so where will young people go

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.740
is a very important question
that I'm trying to answer.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.020
What are they looking for?

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.500
Places that offer opportunity,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.180
work, particularly
professional opportunities,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.900
educational opportunities,
a decent quality of life,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.860
political stability, climate stability,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.100
the basic things that you would expect.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.260
But we need to be clear that countries
need to retrofit themselves,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.660
retool themselves, to try and attract

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.220
and provide those kinds
of environments for young people.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.780
And that's where young people
are going to want to go.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.540
And countries, I believe,
are going to be engaged in a war

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.220
for young talent,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.420
to attract those young people
as they are aging.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.860
So there is a road map for us
to untangle ourselves from this dilemma

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.900
of geopolitical fragmentation,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.500
a climate-stressed world,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.300
a declining population,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.260
youth that are insecure.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.860
What are we supposed to do?

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.700
Well, the thing is, you know,
we can't predict the future,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.980
but we can make scenarios.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.660
So I've constructed these
four scenarios along these axes

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.500
of more or less sustainability
and more or less mobility.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.580
And the truth is that all of these
are visible today.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.420
We are in a world where regions
like Europe act like fortresses.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.620
They're investing
in their own sustainability,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.300
but they try to ward off migration.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.100
We live in a world that's medieval,
a world that is conflictual,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.300
in which people are thrust
into survival mode

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.780
of hunter-gatherer lifestyles.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.140
When there is a drought
or when there's a flood

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.140
or they're fleeing civil war and conflict

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.100
and they're trying to cross borders
like the US-Mexico border,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.940
trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.820
where countries are engaged in land grabs
and water wars to acquire resources.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.980
But we also live in a world
where there are countries like Canada,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.260
which is opening itself up,
that's bringing in hundreds of thousands,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.420
about 400,000 new migrants
every single year,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.060
one percent of its population.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.020
There are a couple of European countries

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.540
that are realizing that they need
to do this as well,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.180
and are kind of changing
their tune around immigration.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.500
And they're trying to do so
in a sustainable way,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.860
focusing on building affordable housing,
decarbonizing their economies,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.980
or at least reducing
emissions and so forth.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.860
The fact is that all of these scenarios
are happening at the same time.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.580
It's incumbent on us to shape
the direction that the world goes in

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.500
or that the regions that we live in
go in, in the future.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.100
Geography is what we make of it.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.900
You know, we have the tools
at our disposal

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.180
to build a different
model of civilization.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.460
And for me, that rests on two principles
or two things that you can do.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.980
You are either moving people to places
where there are resources

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.980
that are abundant so they can survive,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.180
or you're moving technologies to people,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.900
to the places where they need them.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.700
You're doing one of those two things.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.780
If you're not doing one
of those two things,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.180
you should think about how much
you're helping the future, if you will,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.340
and the people of the present
and the future.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.460
The second is, I obviously advocate
for mobility as a human right.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.740
That doesn't mean
that we tear down all borders.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.260
It means that we create systems

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.380
where the mismatches
between old and young,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.860
labor shortages and labor supply,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.700
sustainable and unsustainable
locations is corrected.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.980
And we can do that, but we don't.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.180
We obviously have to think
beyond sovereignty,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.420
therefore to stewardship
of the global commons.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.300
We have to pre-design
these habitats of the future,

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.220
which is to say, thinking about allowing
people to be perpetually mobile

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.540
as they need to be in response
to geopolitics,

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.260
in response to climate change,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.780
but do so in a way that doesn't
trample upon the environment.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.980
Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
TED Member Kim has a question.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.820
Kim asks, "Immigration
to the US seems impossible.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.700
How do we shift the attitude towards
welcoming immigrants here in the US?"

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.060
And their question is US-focused,
but I think this can apply anywhere.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.740
How do we shift the attitude everywhere
to welcoming people into borders?

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.620
PK: It is a universally relevant question,
especially again, in the developed,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.820
mature Western economies and societies

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.940
that have had a lot of friction
and a lot of backlash

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.940
and caution about large-scale immigration,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.380
at least in the last, say, 10, 15 years.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.740
And that's the US, Canada, you know,
Western European countries, Japan,

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.380
all of them are changing to some degree.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.780
The question is how rapidly?

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.260
You know, Canada really stands out
as a country that's welcoming in,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.860
as I mentioned before, you know,
400,000 people a year,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.700
one percent of its population,
as a target growth.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.780
But the US, you know,
as bureaucratic as it is,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.820
as contentious as it is,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.980
and the fact that during the Trump years,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.100
immigration began to decline
and then because of COVID, you know,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.300
became even harder.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.020
But let me tell you something
very special about America.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.500
This year, according to a congressional
delegation I just hosted in Singapore,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.780
the US will probably have
one million new migrants this year.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.220
One million.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.740
I want to be absolutely clear.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:54.660
No country on Earth goes from 200,000
to one million overnight by design.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.460
And that's America, right?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.420
So everything that's not gone well
in immigration can be fixed

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.140
and positively overcompensated
by the kinds of reforms

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.900
that are underway today:
H-1B reforms, refugee reforms,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.660
skilled migration reforms,
digitizing immigration,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.420
carrying over a certain,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.260
you know, frozen quotas from the past.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.780
All of these things
are actually happening.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.660
Should it have happened years ago? Yes.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.380
Should it be happening faster? Yes.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.580
Should immigration policy be done
in a way in which we focus

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.780
on the shortages in our labor force,
which are so many?

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.860
We're hurting our own economy
by having such a slow immigration process.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.180
We should have done all of this
a lot earlier and to a larger degree,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.260
and this would have
depoliticized immigration.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.180
So it's been to our own detriment.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.180
But can America actually fix these things
faster than than we, you know,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.620
very rightly, cynically,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.860
especially if you've been on the wrong
side of the immigration story

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.500
and you've failed to cross a T on a form
and it sets you back like, two years,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.980
you know, you're rightly angry
and cynical about it.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.420
I mean, I'm an immigrant myself,
I didn't move to America till I was six.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.860
I remember becoming a citizen,
I know my parents sweated that paperwork,

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.100
I watched them do it.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.220
But these things can be fixed

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.900
and no one can fix it
like America can, that's for sure.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.540
So there's a lot of hope in that.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.580
And again, European
countries are changing.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.980
Germany brought in, you know,
more than a million,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.420
again, not by design, not intentionally,
but think about the Syrian refugee crisis.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.940
More than a million people
arrived in Germany.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.300
A lot of them have stayed.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.420
More are coming now from Ukraine.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.060
And they've managed their politics

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.980
to fend off, you know,
right-wing populist parties.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.260
They have a center-left
coalition right now.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.060
So Canada, the US, Germany,
the UK, despite Brexit,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.820
it's easier to move to the UK
today than during Brexit.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.540
I’m not sure people realize this.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.620
Because they again have had massive
shortages in nursing and truck drivers,

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.820
you name it.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.300
So there's just two kinds
of countries in the world,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.540
those that have realized
they need more migrants

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.020
and those that haven't, right?

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.580
And those in the former category
are the smarter ones.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.700
And they're going to come out ahead
in the war for young talent.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.580
WPR: TED member Heidi has a question,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.060
"We've seen that governments and countries
veer nationalistic and xenophobic

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.100
when there are a flood of immigrants.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.300
How can we future-proof our democratic
systems against this reactionary outcome?"

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.780
PK: For one thing, you know,
I don't posit that immigration itself,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.820
as in "let the people in,"
is some kind of panacea.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.380
I am a strong believer in assimilation.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.660
And one of the key things
around future proofing

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.500
is maintaining your kind of,
national ethos,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.900
national identity, national culture.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.660
But culture doesn't mean the way things
were for the last 400 years,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.060
and it's never allowed
to change from that, right?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.540
That's a very archaic, you know,

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.900
ethnically and sort of, chauvinistic
approach to the issue.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.300
Culture is valuable.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.180
Culture evolves, culture changes.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.420
If you look at a country like Canada,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.940
again, multiculturalism
is the identity of the country.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.780
The UK is changing its rules
to make it easier to come in.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.980
That's a fact.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.420
It's a legal fact that you can now
come into the UK without a job offer,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.180
without paying a security bond.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.300
We've got these massive
immigration reforms.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.700
So, Japan, there have never been
as many foreigners in Japan

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.900
as there are today.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.100
So even in a place that we think of
as very culturally insular, right,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.460
even there, you've got
a large-scale migration.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.260
So there is zero, zero truth
to the statement

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.420
that the world is governed by right wing,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.380
xenophobic populists
that are anti-immigrant.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.940
It is precisely the exact factual
opposite of that, right?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.820
The important countries of the world

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.060
are governed by pragmatic leaders

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.220
that are recognizing the importance
of large-scale immigration

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.140
as part of their economic health
and their social dynamism.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.220
That is how the important countries
in the world are run today.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.580
That's the way they have
been run for 75 years.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.500
If that weren't true, we wouldn't
be having this conversation

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.780
because, you know, all of us
who are migrants wouldn't have migrated.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.340
We never would have been let in.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.220
WPR: There are some people who may
push back on that, right,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.980
and say that, well, we still see
struggles with inequality

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.540
and that, you know,
things are not fair and great

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.220
for people who do come to those countries.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.540
And I wonder if there are specific things
that you think could be done better

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.740
even in those spaces,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.340
but that are really success stories

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.380
that I think nations that are looking
to invite people in

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.220
can really take on to ensure
that everyone does feel

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.340
like they have a good life.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.380
PK: There are really good lessons learned,

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.340
and this is not pie-in-the-sky thinking.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.900
This is one of the major areas
of political social research,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.540
which is to say, what can we do?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.060
So if you look at smaller
European countries like,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.660
let's say the Netherlands, right,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.700
they have a really strong
language adoption policy.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.900
There is no way you'll get Dutch
citizenship unless you've learned Dutch,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.140
for example.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.740
And Germany is making this clear as well
in a much larger country,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.420
which is, you know,
you definitely have to learn German.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.580
And I think that's actually
pretty important.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.940
I don't seek to suppress
people's original, you know,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.580
identities and their languages.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.220
But it is a fact that if you actually
want to not be a burden

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.420
on your host society,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.860
but actually be a contributor
and be welcomed by, liked by,

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.860
respected by all segments of the society
that is your new home,

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.940
you will do a much better job
of it if you learn the language.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.140
And this is like, you know,
the kind of thing we’d say, OK, well,

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.860
can't we spend a few bucks on that?

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.300
You know, how about we allocate some
money to do some language training,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.580
and that would actually
go a really long way.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.700
So jobs, skills, education,
language, public housing.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.540
So, this is something that’s done
in Singapore, where I live right now.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.980
You know, you've got universal
public housing.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.380
And if we did more
around affordable housing,

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.060
that would diminish the inequality,

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.580
and inequality obviously skews
in many countries,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.780
in immigrant societies,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.260
towards the newly-arrived people
who don't have the economic means.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.060
So well, we can fix that, right?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.620
I mean, there's a physical solution
to inadequate public housing.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.620
It's called building more housing, right?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.820
And you know, if you look
at places again, like Canada,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.620
the Netherlands, France,
this is happening in Finland.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.700
Lots of countries are building
lots more affordable housing

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.180
and it's actually helping to change
some of the local tensions.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.220
So these answers emerge
not from pie-in-the-sky thinking,

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.740
but from the real experience
of real countries.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.100
And there are real
policymakers and journalists

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.500
and civil servants
who have done these things.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.220
It's good news that there's really
a pretty clear road map

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.020
on how to do this and how to make
people feel welcome

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.540
and how to have everyone
again, be better off.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.220
