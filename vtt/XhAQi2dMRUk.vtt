00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000
Good morning, John.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.080
I am a little bit shocked by how much I like
jigsaw puzzles.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.620
Like, you have noticed that I am a little
bit obsessed with productivity.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.040
We can go ahead and say it.
Sometimes it’s unhealthy.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.100
I tie my self worth to my output, and then
often I tie what I imagine to be

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.380
my output to external validation from an audience,
or in economic terms,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.480
or other imperfect surrogates for the magnitude
of “impact,” whatever that is.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.840
A jigsaw puzzle has none of that.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.020
If there is something that has less impact
on the world

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.050
than re-assembling an image of a wintertime
scene, I can’t really think of it.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.500
But jigsaw puzzles trick my mind
into thinking that it matters

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340
without any of the responsibility
of it actually mattering.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.380
And that allows me to - get this - relax and
also spend time with friends and family.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.420
And there are lots of different things I like
about puzzles.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.620
I like how it feels like you get to know every
puzzle and they’re all just a little bit different.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.580
And sometimes they’re very different!

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.800
And the tricks you develop on one puzzle might
not work for another.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.780
And in these ways, doing a puzzle is like
solving any problem.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.460
No two problems are the same,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.220
but as you get the feel of the shape of a
problem, you get better and better at addressing it.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.380
Puzzles also have the advantage of being finite,
and so you know when you’re done solving it,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.900
which is something that real world problems
tend to not have, unfortunately.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.260
I am unlike a lot of puzzle people who I know in that
taking the puzzle apart is actually my favorite part.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:37.180
I just love watching the complete order of a puzzle
being almost instantly reverted to complete disorder.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.620
And not because I like love chaos and destruction.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.049
Like a little bit I do.
But mos - but here’s the thing.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.950
I love seeing how hard it is to build something
and how easy it is to destroy it.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
Now, that might not sound like a good thought,
but I think it actually is.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.150
Because if it is much easier to destroy than build -
this is mathematically true so you can’t really deny it -

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.820
then everything that remains built, every problem
that gets solved, every disease that gets cured,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.500
everything that just works remains that way
only because of human action.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.060
Only because of billions of people placing
puzzle pieces every day, carefully, and thoughtfully.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.740
Obviously, during the Project for Awesome,
we are focused on problems.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.069
And the puzzles we’re solving here are not
puzzles that have the luxury of not mattering.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.320
So, we have to look a lot at the problems,
and they can feel very heavy.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.580
But they need to be looked at,
and they need to be understood.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.080
And we need to support,
the master puzzle-solvers out there

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.160
who understand the unique shape
of each one of these things.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.319
Like the people who work at Partners in Health
and Save the Children,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.960
the charities the Project for Awesome is supporting
in its first half.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.770
The puzzle of healthcare isn’t simple anywhere,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.930
but these organizations help communities build
more robust healthcare, decrease illness,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.360
they provide stability, and they make the
world a better place.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.820
Everyone who supports the Project for Awesome
by making a video, supporting a charity,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.840
joining us on the livestream, or getting some
perks at projectforawesome.com/donate…

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.800
You are helping put puzzle pieces down
where they most need to be.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.400
The problems of the world can feel like a
weight, but they can also feel like a puzzle that,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.200
yes, we’re never gonna finish, but that
brings a better world with every piece we lay.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.140
And the Project for Awesome, by the way, begins
shortly at noon eastern time!

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.580
And you can join us for 48 hours

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.540
of fun and fundraising and silliness and thoughtfulness
at projectforawesome.com/live.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.720
John, I will see you on the livestream!

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.909
