00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.800
This video is all about Albert Einstein,&nbsp;
yes, that guy again. Einstein is famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.400
for his theory of general relativity. It’s&nbsp;
taught us that gravity is not a force. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.560
that’s probably the most misunderstood physics&nbsp;
fact, ever. Like, even physicists get it wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.360
all the time. Gravity is not a force. And&nbsp;
since there’s no force pushing down on you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.920
that means you are currently&nbsp;
accelerating upward. Unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.600
you’re watching this from the ISS, in&nbsp;
which case please say hi to the moon.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:40.760
How does gravity work if it’s not a&nbsp;
force? That’s what we’ll talk about today.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.960
An accelerometer is a device that measures&nbsp;
acceleration. If you’d hold an accelerometer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.200
steadily in your hand, it’d tell you it’s&nbsp;
accelerated upwards. This isn’t hypothetical,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.800
weird theoretical physics talk.&nbsp;
You can buy one and just see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.480
it says. This is an example of how the&nbsp;
reading of an accelerometer looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.280
when it’s lying still on a table. It&nbsp;
tells you it’s accelerated upwards.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.760
And this is entirely correct. If you hold an&nbsp;
accelerometer still on the surface on earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.120
it’s indeed accelerated upward. Why does&nbsp;
that surprise you? If you hold something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.480
on your hand you feel that it's pressing&nbsp;
against your hand, downward. It’s like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.440
when you’re trying to accelerate a car&nbsp;
with your hand. It’ll push against it.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.560
Ifyou hold something in your hand, that’s not&nbsp;
the gravitational force pushing it down. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.280
gravity isn’t a force. It’s pushing on your&nbsp;
hand because you are accelerating it upward.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.600
Why is the thing in your hand accelerated if&nbsp;
you don’t move your hand? It’s because *you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.600
are accelerated. And *you are accelerated&nbsp;
because there’s a force pushing on you from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.200
below. That’s the floor, or rather the atomic&nbsp;
bonds in the floor and in the ground below.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.240
You see, the entire earth has internal&nbsp;
pressure, otherwise it’d collapse. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.440
pressure generates a force on everything on the&nbsp;
surface. And as Newton taught us, a force creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.760
acceleration. So that pressure of Earth creates&nbsp;
a force which accelerates you on the surface.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.440
But wait, you may say, there’s also&nbsp;
the gravitational force pushing down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.760
so the two forces balance to zero, right?&nbsp;
No—oo. Because gravity is not a force.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.960
Gravity is a consequence of moving&nbsp;
in a space-time that’s been curved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.360
by the presence of masses. If there are&nbsp;
no masses nearby to curve space-time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.120
it’s flat. So long as there’s no force&nbsp;
acting on an object in this flat space-time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.760
the object will move in a straight line. If&nbsp;
there are masses nearby, space-time will curve,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.480
and the object no longer move on a straight&nbsp;
line, even in the absence of a force.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.680
The usual way to explain this is with a large&nbsp;
marble on a rubber sheet, that deforms the rubber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.760
This is an analogy for how, say, a planet curves&nbsp;
space-time around it. And then another, smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.800
marble which seems to be “attracted” to the bigger&nbsp;
one. It’s a pretty good visualization, it’s just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.960
that you shouldn’t ask why the big marble bends&nbsp;
the rubber, then it gets really confusing.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.760
So in this curved space around a planet,&nbsp;
if there’s no force acting on you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.480
you fall towards the planet. That’s not an&nbsp;
acceleration. But if something gets in your way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.400
like the surface of the planet, then *that&nbsp;
creates a force. So now you’re accelerated.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.160
This is why there’s no force pushing down on you&nbsp;
right now. There’s only a force pushing up. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.400
took away the surface of earth, you’d fall. And if&nbsp;
you fell, there’d be again no force acting on you.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.680
This is also why the earth would collapse if&nbsp;
it had no internal pressure. It’s not because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.440
there’s a gravitational force acting on the&nbsp;
matter. Because gravity isn’t a force. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.560
because without internal pressure, stuff&nbsp;
would just freely fall in the curvature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.760
that it itself creates. Without internal&nbsp;
pressure, earth would form a tiny black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.080
hole about 3 mm in diameter and the&nbsp;
real estate market would go to hell.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.200
But let’s go back to the accelerometer to see what&nbsp;
else they can tell us. The easiest example of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.640
accelerometer is a spring. Yes, a plain boring&nbsp;
spring. Suppose you put a spring into outer space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.600
empty space, flat space. How does it get there?&nbsp;
I don’t know, maybe Bob the astronaut lost it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.160
on a spacewalk? I hear these things happen.
Ok, there’s a spring in outer space for whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.720
reason. It’ll have some extension. Now if you tie&nbsp;
that spring to a rocket and that rocket blasts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.880
off, what’s going to happen with the spring?&nbsp;
It’ll expand so long as the velocity of the rocket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.200
changes. Why is that? Well, as Newton taught us&nbsp;
force equals mass times acceleration. So if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.560
accelerate one end of the spring, that creates&nbsp;
a force and that force stretches the spring. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.840
can measure how much it stretches, and from that&nbsp;
you can calculate how much it was accelerated.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.400
Yeah, I know this isn’t exactly rocket science&nbsp;
even if it is, but bear with me for a moment. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.320
example tells us three very important things.
First, you can use a spring to measure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.960
acceleration. It’s not the only way to do it, and&nbsp;
maybe not even a particularly good one, but works.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.680
Second, you cannot, of course, use the&nbsp;
spring to measure the velocity of the rocket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.880
because velocity in and of itself is a&nbsp;
meaningless concept. You can only talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.640
about relative velocities, not absolute&nbsp;
ones. This is why Einstein’s theories have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.440
the word “relative” in them.
This brings us to the third,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.200
and most important point that we learn from&nbsp;
the spring. Acceleration is not relative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.000
it’s absolute. You can measure&nbsp;
how much you’re accelerated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.640
for example with that spring. And you&nbsp;
can tell when you are not accelerated.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.080
So we have a spring on a rocket in outer space,&nbsp;
alright. What’s this got to do with gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.360
Well this is where Einstein’s genius comes&nbsp;
in. Einstein said, let’s put the spring in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.960
a box from which you can’t look out. You have no&nbsp;
idea what’s going on outside. We tie the box with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.280
you and the spring to a rocket. The rocket blasts&nbsp;
off. What happens? Well, the spring expands again.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.960
Einstein now said that if you’re in the box,&nbsp;
you can’t tell whether you’re being accelerated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.600
or whether you are sitting still on&nbsp;
the surface of a planet. He then said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.080
if there isn’t any measurement that you&nbsp;
can do to tell these situations apart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.360
they’re physically indistinguishable. That is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.880
in a small box, the effect of gravity on the&nbsp;
surface of a planet is indistinguishable from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.000
acceleration in the absence of gravity. This&nbsp;
is what’s called the “Equivalence Principle”.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.320
The point where people usually go wrong is to&nbsp;
conclude that because gravity is indistinguishable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.240
from acceleration, that means gravity accelerates&nbsp;
you. But that isn’t so. Because to accelerate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.520
something, you need a force. And gravity is&nbsp;
not a force. Einstein’s equivalence principle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.600
says that you are accelerated if you sit *still&nbsp;
in a gravitational field. This is because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.200
only way to sit still in a gravitational field&nbsp;
is to have a force acting on you that prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.920
you from falling. For example, because that&nbsp;
floor is pushing on you. But you can’t tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.320
this apart from being accelerated in the&nbsp;
absence of gravity, in a flat spacetime.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.920
Imagine for example you are falling into a black&nbsp;
hole. No, I don’t mean YouTube recommendations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.680
I mean a literal black hole. You are in a box with&nbsp;
your spring and without any rocket boosters and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:14.480
on. The black hole curves space-time, and you can&nbsp;
use the equations of Einstein’s general relativity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.720
to calculate what happens. They’ll tell you&nbsp;
that if you get too close to the horizon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.920
you’ll inevitably cross it and then you’ll end&nbsp;
up in the singularity. Which might not be there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.080
but that’s a different story. The point&nbsp;
for today is that your spring won’t budge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.000
because there’s no force acting on&nbsp;
you. Because gravity is not a force.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.440
This is what physicists mean by “free fall”&nbsp;
in a gravitational field. It means there’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.680
no force acting on you, so you’re not&nbsp;
accelerated. A zero-g flight is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.000
closest you’ll get to that on earth&nbsp;
– at least if you want to survive.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.240
The idea of a zero-g flight is exactly einstein’s&nbsp;
elevator experiment. That if you’re in a box whose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.120
floor is not pushing on you, that’s the plane,&nbsp;
you can’t tell whether you’re in outer space far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.720
away from any heavy objects, where space-time&nbsp;
is flat, or whether you’re freely falling in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.760
curved space-time. Physically, it’s exactly&nbsp;
the same. So the zero-g flight is indeed a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.280
good simulation for outer space. And why is that?&nbsp;
It’s because gravity is not a force. In the plane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.920
you are falling in a gravitational field,&nbsp;
but there’s no force acting on you.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.560
Now, I sometimes hear people say that “zero-g”&nbsp;
is a bad term because it suggests that there’s no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.360
gravity, but of course the curvature of space-time&nbsp;
doesn’t go away just because you sit in a plane.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.280
And that’s right, but zero-g doesn’t mean&nbsp;
zero-gravity. The “g” is the local acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.520
that you experience if you are in rest in&nbsp;
the gravitational field. If you are on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.280
earth’s surface, that acceleration is roughly&nbsp;
nine point eight meters per square second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.200
as you probably all learned in kindergarten.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.560
Though, strictly speaking, this gravitational&nbsp;
acceleration isn’t constant. The acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.480
that you experience on the surface of&nbsp;
earth drops if you go to higher altitudes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.920
and it also slightly depends on what the&nbsp;
ground is made of. This is why measuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.280
this acceleration tells you something about the&nbsp;
composition of earth’s mantle, but I digress.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.840
To come back to zero-g flights. On&nbsp;
a zero-g flight your acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.920
is indeed almost zero because you’re&nbsp;
not at rest with the surface of earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.480
that’s why it feels like free fall.&nbsp;
Of course it’s not exactly zero,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.840
because you always move around somewhat that way&nbsp;
or this way, or if you’re Rohin you are doing CPR,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:00.560
but it’s pretty close to zero. So I’d say, zero-g&nbsp;
is a good description. Same thing on the ISS.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.040
Okay, but I can see that you’re still&nbsp;
confused because you learned that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.480
acceleration is a change in velocity.&nbsp;
And if you’re not changing velocity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.240
you’re just standing on earth,&nbsp;
how can you be accelerated?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.760
Well, the entire point of einstein’s&nbsp;
theory of relativity is that velocity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.760
is not an absolute. What you mean if you say&nbsp;
you’re not changing velocity is that you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.440
not moving relative to the surface of earth.&nbsp;
But this doesn’t mean you have zero velocity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.240
because that’s a meaningless statement.&nbsp;
It just means you are not moving relative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.440
to something else that’s accelerated the&nbsp;
same way, which is the surface of earth.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.160
You can, however, return to talking about&nbsp;
Newtonian gravity by re-defining what you mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.620
by “no acceleration”. In general relativity, as&nbsp;
we have just seen, you are accelerated if you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.160
not move relative to the surface of the earth,&nbsp;
say because you stand on top of a building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.200
If you jump and fall, you are not accelerated&nbsp;
because there’s no force acting on you. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:11.120
hit the floor, you are very suddenly accelerated&nbsp;
again which has, erm, measurable consequences.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.320
In Newtonian gravity, you introduce this&nbsp;
new force that you call the gravitational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.760
force and say if you’re on top of the&nbsp;
building that force of gravity cancels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.080
that from the building pushing on you. So&nbsp;
now there’s no net force acting on you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.520
Newton says you’re not accelerated. If you&nbsp;
jump off the building, Newton would say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.160
the force from below disappears and there’s only&nbsp;
the gravitational force acting on you and you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.880
accelerated. And if you hit the ground,&nbsp;
you suddenly return to zero acceleration.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.360
The Newtonian picture is the one we learn&nbsp;
at school, and it’s useful so long as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.960
are on earth. But strictly speaking it’s&nbsp;
wrong because you can’t just redefine what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.840
you mean by zero acceleration. You&nbsp;
can’t do that because acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.360
it’s not a relativity quantity. If you’re&nbsp;
staying in place in a gravitational field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:10.960
so you are not falling, then you are not at zero&nbsp;
acceleration as any accelerometer will tell you.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.600
Now of course physicists are no linguistic&nbsp;
saints, and they’ll sometimes refer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.560
gravity as a force even though it isn’t.&nbsp;
A typical example is when they speak of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.880
the “four fundamental forces of nature”. If&nbsp;
they’re being careful though, they’ll refer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.480
to it as the “gravitational interaction”&nbsp;
and the “four fundamental interactions”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.000
But often they don’t. I think they really just&nbsp;
call it a force because that starts with an “F”.&nbsp;

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.800
In a nutshell, why is gravity not a&nbsp;
force? Because if you are only exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.280
to the gravitational interaction, you fall,&nbsp;
and that is measurably not an acceleration.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.240
If you need to freshen up your knowledge on&nbsp;
forces and Newton’s laws before taking on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.440
Einstein’s ideas, the best place to start&nbsp;
is brilliant dot org. They have lovely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.960
courses on Newtonian gravity and classical&nbsp;
mechanics and even on special relativity.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.440
And not just that. Brilliant offers courses&nbsp;
on a large variety of topics in science,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:16.920
computer science, and mathematics. If you&nbsp;
want to learn something new or brush up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.040
something you learned long ago, Brillant is an&nbsp;
easy and fun way to do it. All their courses are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.400
interactive with follow-up questions. They&nbsp;
come with graphics that you can play with,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.240
and some have little executable python scripts&nbsp;
or videos with demonstration experiments.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.920
I like learning things on brilliant because I can&nbsp;
do it everywhere and whenever I have the time. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:46.720
they’re adding new content every month, on timely&nbsp;
topics such as solar panels, quantum computing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.640
neural nets, or computational biology. I even&nbsp;
have my own course on Brilliant which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.680
beginner’s course to quantum mechanics.&nbsp;
This will introduce you to the basics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.840
like what superpositions and entanglement&nbsp;
are, and how interference works. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.280
after that you can continue with the&nbsp;
other quantum courses on Brilliant.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.640
