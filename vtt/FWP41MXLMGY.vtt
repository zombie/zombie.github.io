[wind blowing]

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.370
I've been inside, locked down for...

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.370
eight months at this point.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.020
And, while I'm naturally an indoor sort of person,

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.540
you can get too much of a good thing.

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.000
So, I bought this bike for

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210
allowed outdoor exercise

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.440
and to do some exploration

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.480
to bring back a bit of novelty into my same-y life.

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.640
But I've been quarantined from COVID so strictly that

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.310
I'm a bit apprehensive about going outside.

12

[oh hello, swan]

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
But spring and summer have already passed me by.

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.880
I'm not going to miss autumn too.

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.860
So let's head out into this brief and beautiful season and

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.020
see what pandemic London is like.

This dragon and the one across the street

21
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.090
mark the boundary between London and the City of London.

22
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.470
There are ten more dragons that guard the borders

23
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.370
that are copies of these two originals

24
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.110
and there is a unique thirteenth dragon

25
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.940
that we can find by going down that little street.

[hopeful electronic music, Sindrandi plays "Nuna"]

30
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.240
I see that London has made a bunch of changes to the roads

31
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.200
and bridges to be more bike friendly during the pandemic.

32
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.720
It's great!

33
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.790
I hope they keep some of these changes.

Woah  ... ughhh.

37
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.210
Yeah, I am going that way, okay.

[wind blowing]

39
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.590
I've never seen the Tower of London so quiet.

40
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.290
I'm used to being here when it's just packed.

41
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.590
On form field trips, I always volunteered for the job

42
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.040
of shepherding students to the Tower of London

43
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.840
because the British teachers were well over it, but not me.

44
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.070
Because of this national lockdown, the Tower has had

45
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.080
to let go of some of the Yeomen Warders,

46
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.190
who are the famous guards of the Tower and

47
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.000
who also live in the Tower

48
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.350
and give amazing tours of the Tower.

49
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.530
It's just tragic.

50
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.290
But, if you can't sell tickets

51
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.440
and you can't open the gift shop, what can you do?

52
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.190
I guess, when this pandemic is over,

53
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.930
if you come to London, visit the Tower!

54
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.430
Take the Yeoman tour.

55
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.430
Keep an eye out for the ravens.

56
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.320
I wasn't sure how far I'd go, so I brought supplies.

57
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.220
My plan this morning was just to get to the Tower

58
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.220
and then return to the safety of home but

59
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.860
I may never get to see the city like this again so

60
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.970
I'm going to keep pushing.

[serene electronic music, Amaranth Cove plays "Balance"]

62
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.490
Looks like a couple of shops are open.

63
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.390
I'm not going to enter an enclosed space but,

64
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.540
good luck to you little cafes!

Wow, that was great!

67
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.570
I'd never seen that little passage before.

68
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.350
No stopping now.

69
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.890
On to the Docklands.

[equipment thuds]

78
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.570
I know the cause is a global catastrophe,

79
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.980
but the result,

80
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.470
this feeling of being in an empty city

81
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.630
if you're the right kind of person

82
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.390
it's ethereal solitude.

83
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.890
I'm going to stay here, recharge,

84
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.260
and then I can't not continue onward.

86
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.240
This building at the southern tip of the Docklands

87
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.360
is one of my favorite buildings in the whole of London!

88
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.630
It's heartbreakingly missed

89
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.380
and if we go around back you can see

90
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.800
there's a matching one on the other side of the river.

91
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.110
And connecting the two is a tunnel from 1899

92
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.430
that's still operational.

93
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.640
Once you're here, crossing is irresistible.

If the elevator is broken on the other end

95
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.540

in the National Maritime Museum.

111
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.120
He was not very good at teaching then.

120
