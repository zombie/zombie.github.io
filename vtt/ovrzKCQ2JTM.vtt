00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Good morning Hank, it’s Tuesday.
Today I want to talk about the&nbsp;

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.080
phrase H of G which is maybe my
very favorite saying of the many, many,&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.600
many sayings of Dr. Paul Farmer the co-founder
of Partners in Health who died last month&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.520
at the age of 62. H of G is short for
hermeneutics of generosity. Now if you’re&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.360
anything like me, you run screaming from
the mere existence of the word hermeneutics.&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.040
Like there are many reasons I chose not to go
to divinity school after working as a&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.720
hospital chaplain, but the thought of
having to use the word hermeneutics&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.720
a lot was certainly on the list. But
basically hermeneutics just means&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.040
interpretation. A hermeneutics is like
the interpretive lens you bring to&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.640
looking at a text. Especially a sacred
text. And because I was a double&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760
major in English and religious studies,
by the time I graduated from college&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.600
I had been hermeneuted half to death
and the word had sort of lost all&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.720
meaning to me until that is, I heard
Dr. Farmer talk about a hermeneutics&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.920
of generosity. Here’s how Paul once defined
an H of G, “I know you’re a good guy.&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.560
Therefore, I will interpret the things you
say and do in a favorable light.”&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.760
That’s the H of G. I know you’re
a good person so I will interpret&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.200
what you say and do in a favorable
light. Even if I don’t know you.&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.960
I will assume you are a good person
unless I have very strong evidence&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.320
to the contrary because almost
everyone is trying their best.&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.000
And almost everyone sees their
own actions in a generous light.&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.440
So I’m going to try and do that too.
The H of G is, like most things,&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.560
much easier to say than to do.
What are things that are easier&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.480
to do than they are to say?
Rumination. It’s not that hard&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.480
to say, but it’s just so easy to do.
Anyways, the H of G is hard to&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.200
do in practice, right? Like imagine
you’re in a grocery store and&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440
you’re on a tight schedule and
you only have a couple items.&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040
And the person in front of you
has like 14 crumpled coupons&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.480
that they’re smoothing out one
by one so that they can be scanned&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.000
and the whole process is taking forever.
It’s relatively simple to deploy&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.120
the H of G in this situation, right?
You just tell yourself that&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.080
this person’s children crumpled
up the coupons and that the&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.520
coupons are really important to
them being able to afford groceries.&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.400
But what if this person is digging
those coupons out of a designer&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.680
purse that you happen to know
costs 4,000 dollars. What if they’re&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.440
yelling at the supermarket clerk
for failing to scan the coupons fast&nbsp;

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.520
enough, or yelling at you for reasons
that aren’t entirely clear to you.&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.600
Now it’s getting much harder to
deploy the H of G. Harder, but&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
not, Dr. Farmer would argue,
impossible. When people yell,&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840
it is because they are afraid or angry.&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.240
And I have found that when I can
deploy an H of G which certainly&nbsp;

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.200
isn’t all the time, I am on average
more empathetic, more curious,&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.920
more engaged, and less judgemental,
angry, and miserable. Now this is&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.920
not in any way to minimize the role
that anger and disgust play in bringing&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.240
about change. I think we should be
angry about injustice, and I think the&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.480
world’s shared apathy to the most
poor and the most marginalized&nbsp;

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.520
should bother us. But I also think
if we look at the world through a&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.560
lens of generosity and a presumption
of general good faith, the shared big&nbsp;

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.520
problems of injustice and inequity
\are no longer merely about people&nbsp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.080
being terrible or systems being
inherently crappy. Instead, these&nbsp;

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.800
problems become about failures.
Failures of empathy, failures of resource&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.560
allocation, and failures of will.
We can address those failures.&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.920
They aren’t inevitable or necessary.
We can see from history how they’ve&nbsp;

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920
already changed. And so now,
progress feels possible. Not only that,&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.800
but the world’s profound and horrific
injustice becomes even more profound&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400
and horrific. Because we know now
that together we can choose a&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.120
better world. And so I think an H of G
is hard work precisely because it asks&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.600
us to believe that together we can
address our shared problems.&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.400
The failures of empathy and resource
allocation that led to marginalization&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.480
and impoverishment. Dr. Farmer left
us with many legacies. But that is one&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.280
I’m trying to hold onto in these
difficult days. Hank, I’ll see you on Friday.
