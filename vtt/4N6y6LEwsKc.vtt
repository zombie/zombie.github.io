00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
How does a story go about saying something? And when we say "this story is saying something",

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.520
what, exactly, do we mean?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.800
and, when it happens, how do we recognize that the story is saying something?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.100
These are the questions I found myself chewing over in the weeks after I played The Beginner's Guide,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.940
a strange metatextual monster of an Indie game from the creator of The Stanley Parable.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.460
It's a project that doesn't so much break the fourth wall as to be seemingly constructed without one.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.540
I'll show you what I mean.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.580
&gt;&gt; Davey: Hi there. My name is Davey Wreden. I wrote The Stanley Parable.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.880
Thank you very much for playing The Beginner's Guide.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.180
We're going to look at the games made by a friend of mine named Coda.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.920
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: So our narrator, Davey, flat-out tells us how the game is meant to be interpreted, which is to say - it isn't.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.880
This is a walking tour of a number of small art games by his friend Coda,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.800
and Davey is going to tell us as we play what he thinks they mean.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.680
The only interpretation that needs doing is to be done by Davey.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400
and what he means to say, he means to say plainly.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.580
&gt;&gt; Davey: I want us to see past the games themselves.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.620
I want to get to know who this human being really is.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.700
And that's exactly what we're going to do here.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.220
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: Now, core to Davey's conceit is that to fully understand

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.420
Coda's games you need Davey. These games were made by Coda for his own enjoyment, not for public consumption,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.600
so to really "get" them you need both a player's perspective and a designer's perspective.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.800
During play, Davey makes walls transparent to reveal architecture that is built

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520
but the player would normally never see,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.280
and he lets the player into rooms they normally wouldn't have access to.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.420
Other times Davey skips you to the end of a labyrinth or opens a door that's not supposed to open for an hour,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.239
because, to his mind, you can get the idea of "I'm supposed to wait" or "there is a labyrinth" without actually experiencing

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.389
the tedium of those things. These skips and elisions are things Coda himself might do as he play tests the games.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.599
What the player comes to understand by the end is that Davey has in fact been making far deeper alterations.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.420
He's not just making the games playable or more understandable, but, from his perspective, he's making them more coherent

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.280
and those alterations he didn't admit to us. For instance.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.560
HE's been putting these optimistic lamp posts at the end of levels

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.640
because he feels they SHOULD be there.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.120
His thinking is that he understands what Coda meant to do, and he is making the games

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.940
"more themselves".

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.800
But that means making a lot of assumptions about what Coda meant and what Coda wants.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.580
When Coda discovers that Davey has been sharing altered versions of his games with other people,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.460
he makes one final game just for Davey and then quits game design entirely.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.972
And that last game is unplayable without Davey's meddling;

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.480
it has an invisible labyrinth, a combination you have to brute-force, and a door that never opens unless you alter the game's code.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.440
And after all that, Davey, having utterly failed Coda's test, is confronted with exactly what he's been searching for;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.840
a message from the game's creator.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.000
&gt;&gt; Davey: I am the reason that you stopped making games aren't I?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940
It's because of what I did.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.060
I poisoned it for you.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.300
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: What Davey has done is he's turned Coda into a symbol of a brilliant but tortured artist,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.680
and Coda is no longer interested in being a symbol.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.980
Davey has been treating the occasional darker themes in Coda's games as

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.980
a "problem" he needs to "fix" and Davey is not really analyzing these games to understand Coda better, but for his own gratification.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.300
Analyzing Coda's games and explaining them to other people makes Davey feel creative

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.020
in a way his own work doesn't;

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.860
in a way that he imagines Coda feels all the time.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.900
&gt;&gt; Davey: Even though I was showing your work. It was...

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.080
[footsteps in game]

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I felt GOOD about myself.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.020
Finally, for a moment, while I had that, I liked myself.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.920
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: Now, I'm not just here to describe The Beginner's Guide to you,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.440
I have a bit more purpose than that,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.880
but The Beginner's Guide is core to what we are here to discuss,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.620
and to proceed, let's clarify a few things.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.100
This video, this thing you're watching right now, is built on two assumptions:

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.940
Assumption One is that all the things I just told you about The Beginner's Guide

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.460
aren't real.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.600
There isn't actually a game designer named Coda,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.860
and Davey didn't actually steal his games and sell them on Steam.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.540
The narrator Davey is a fictional character created by the real-life Davey Wreden,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.260
and you know what, for the sake of convenience. we're going to delineate between them.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.680
We'll call the fictional narrator Davey The Narrator and the flesh-and-blood game designer Davey Prime.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.820
Assumption Two is that by the end of the game the player is supposed to realize that none of it is true.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.560
That understanding is part of the text; there is still a fourth wall.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.220
So just in case you thought a game couldn't possibly be more meta than The Stanley Parable,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.560
this is SUPER META.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.400
In much of the critical discussion around The Beginner's Guide,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.840
Coda is a sticking point, because even if people agree that he's not real (and not everyone does) they often start asking:

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.500
"Okay, but how not real is he?"

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.960
People start to wonder whether it's a fictional account of something that actually happened.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.100
in the wake of the unexpected success of The Stanley Parable, Davey Prime released a rather eloquent blog about depression and self-doubt,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.360
sentiments very directly echoed in Davey The Narrator's dialogue.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.649
So in that time did Davey Prime develop an unhealthy relationship with another game designer,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.090
whose creativity he was envious of? Did he betray their trust? And did he funnel that experience into his next game? And, if so,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.540
who were they?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.340
But at the end of the day the only thing really at stake in that line of inquiry is

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.260
"what kind of asshole is or isn't Davey Prime?"

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.560
The other prevailing theory is that "Coda" is just Davey Prime talking to his younger self

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.860
and these "debates" about authenticity tend to cloud any discussion of, if we simply accept that the game is a fiction and move on from there,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.360
what the game has to say.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.020
And that may be because what The Beginner's Guide is trying to say is

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.560
reeeeally fucking slippery.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.680
Because the game is just so meta, it's SUPER META! Which made me wonder whenever I tried to engage with it

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.620
just how meta my engagement should be.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.940
For example, Davey The Narrator

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.849
clearly suffers from imposter syndrome. The game is from his perspective,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.980
so my reflex is to identify with that anxiety.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.380
But by the end of the game, it's not only clear that he's done something really shitty, but that he's a fictional character.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.320
So my next question is, "does Davey Prime want me to question the fact that I reflexively identify with a shitty person

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.600
provided they have a pain I recognize and they control my point of view?"

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:40.520
and then, OR: "does Davey Prime want me to question the fact that I asked myself that question and then projected that intention on to him?"

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.200
and then OR: "does Davey Prime want me to question the fact that I asked myself THAT question and then projected THAT intention onto him?"

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.860
and on and on like this.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.140
We knew Davey The Narrator's intentions,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.130
But we don't know Davey Prime's.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.720
Anything the game might be saying

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.340
might also be a meditation on the fact that you think the game is saying that.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.560
So is this a story where conversations

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.200
about how real are not real the contents are have largely overtaken any meaningful discussion of what it actually has to say?

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.620
Or is it one with so many layers of metatextuality and ironic distancing

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.880
that it's arguably not about anything other than itself?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.120
Well I happen to think that, at the end of it all, the game has at least one thing concretely to say,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.700
but before we can talk about it

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.520
we need a framework for talking about it and to build that framework (and maybe you saw this coming)

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.420
We're gonna have to go meta.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.640
WAY meta.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.380
We're going to talk about the fundamental nature of storytelling.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.580
But before that we're going to talk about the fundamental nature of authorship,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.260
and before that we're gonna talk about the fundamental nature of language.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.520
Also, we're going to spoil the ending of the Sopranos for some reason, so don't say I didn't warn you

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
SUPER META. Let's get started.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:02.940
[gentle guitar music]

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.820
Let's start with a word. Like

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.180
"tree".

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.060
Chances are if I say the word tree, you know what I'm talking about.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.940
Say I want to tell you about a specific tree, like, say, the one in the front yard of the house I grew up in.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.160
What can I tell you about it?

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.520
Well, I can tell you that it was big.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.960
As a kid, the span of my arms could only go about a quarter of the way around the trunk,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.900
and the county required us at least once to prune it because the branches were touching the power lines.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.699
I can tell you how the bark felt to touch; it had this kind of grooved pattern, almost like tire treads?

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.699
But rougher and it felt almost

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:37.629
crumbly, like if I ran my palm across it I'd almost expect the bark to slough off in clods like dirt

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.309
I can tell you about the leaves, how they were a darker green than most of the other trees in the area,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.570
almost round but with a sharp point at the end; how they were smooth and waxy on the top

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.260
but the underside collected dust which I'd compulsively wipe off with my thumb.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.360
What I can't do is take my experience of this tree and

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.380
beam it telepathically into your brain,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.740
so I'm using language.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.300
I'm breaking down that experience into its constituent elements

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.720
(colors, textures, images, sensations)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.100
translating those into words and giving the words to you, so you can translate them into your own set of sensations,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.120
and try to reconstruct the thing that's in my head.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.740
Now for this to work it requires a certain commonality between us.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.220
Not just that you, ya know, speak English and your vocabulary is such that you understand most of the words I'm using,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.260
but also commonality of experience;

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.180
that you know what a dark green looks like, how tire treads feel, how far off the ground power lines are.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.380
And since the lived experience you associate with those words will never be identical to mine,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.780
the math won't entirely add up the same for you as it does for me.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.160
The reality is that the tree in your head is going to be different from mine,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.920
and since you also can't telepathically beam your tree into my head so I can compare it with mine,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.440
we may know /that/ they're different, but we don't really know /how/.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.500
Now imagine instead of talking about my experience of a tree,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.510
I'm talking about far more subjective experiences,

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:05.349
like pain, or doubt, or love, and you'll see what I'm getting at.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.600
Inside every brain are thoughts in a mother tongue spoken by only one person,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.120
and to speak and be heard

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.580
is to go from one private language into a shared code and then into another private language

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.280
The translation is always imperfect. The fact that human beings can communicate at all is sort of amazing.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.440
I mean, depending on how evocative I am with language I can get you pretty close

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.980
but ultimately, communication is always settling for "good enough".

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.260
A big takeaway here is that the thing in your head

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.240
is yours--or, it's kind of ours?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.530
I supplied the blueprint, you supplied the materials, so in a sense

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.909
we made it together, but since we built it in your head, and I'll never get to see it,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.900
you're the one who gets to keep it.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.600
The point here is, all communication is collaborative.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.440
Even when I'm the only one speaking, we make meaning together.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:07.720
[gentle guitar music]

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.820
In his book "About Writing", author and essayist Samuel R Delany

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.180
describes the act of reading a story like this: "However much, as readers, we lose ourselves in a novel or a story,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.520
fiction itself is an experience on the order of memory--not on the order of actual occurrence.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.200
It /looks/ like the writer is telling you a story.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:33.080
what the writer is actually doing, however, is using words to evoke a series of micro memories from your own experience

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.540
that inmix, join, and connect in your mind in an order the writer controls,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.880
so that, in effect, you have a sustained memory of something that never happened to you.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.500
That false memory is what a story is.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.580
When our conversation is a

00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:51.680
fantastical story read from the page, or the screen of your Kindle,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.420
rather than an anecdote shared casually with a friend, there are several major differences;

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.120
among them that A: you and I

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.080
usually both know that what I'm saying isn't actually true, and

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.480
B: that I'm no longer in the room. We're not two normal people having a conversation,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm an author and you're...the public.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.380
This shift changes our responsibilities regarding one another.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.620
All meaning is (still) collaborative, but when the author is not physically present, or when they are present

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.180
But they can't "drop character" as in, like,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.200
theatre, performance art, or public readings,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.400
then the creation of that meaning has a different "division of labor".

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.280
If a dialogue is one part Interpretation one part conversation,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.940
a book is all interpretation.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.680
You can't ask me what I mean. All the information you're going to get is in the book,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.860
or in the occasional supplementary material.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.840
So your role is a bit more like that of a detective;

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.220
you take what you know from the text, or what you think you know, and essentially

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.900
construct a theory of meaning: if this means this, and this means this, then this...

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.420
proooobably means this?

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.620
The text may strike you as clear or confused or at odds with itself,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.250
but in any case you draw what meaning you can from it and...

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.200
that's that.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.960
That's as true as anything you're going to get.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.510
What goes on in your head always belongs to you,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.520
but doubly so in the case of fiction.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:26.620
Like, if someone says "I think Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy" and someone else says "I think he didn't", there is an objective truth to the matter.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.500
One of these people is necessarily wrong.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.960
But if someone says "I think Tony dies at the end of The Sopranos" and someone else says "I think he lives",

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.960
there is no objective truth.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.540
What the ending of The Sopranos means to you isn't up to anyone else because

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.920
Tony Soprano isn't real.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.150
Whatever doesn't happen explicitly within the text cannot be proven, only theorized.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:56.220
I mean, okay, if someone says "I think Tony reveals his true nature and assumes the role of the new Dalai Lama", that is...

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.780
an... unsound theory,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.740
but the fact that some theories are crap doesn't mean that any one theory is correct.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.489
There's just differing subjective degrees to which they are meaningful.

00:14:09.489 --> 00:14:14.180
So if so much of the "work" of creating meaning falls on you as an audience member,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.100
how much does the author even matter?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.320
Like, if David Chase (and he would never actually do this) comes out and says "Tony totally dies at the end of The Sopranos",

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.540
what are you even supposed to do with that information?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.440
Did he just solve the case of Tony Soprano?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.700
On the one hand, knowing the writer's intentions

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.020
is certainly a big piece of information for your theory, and maybe that solves some of the confusing parts, but on the other hand,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.280
fuck this guy!

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.300
He wasn't even there!

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.559
if he didn't want you to theorize, he would have put what happened to Tony up on the screen.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.120
He doesn't get to swoop in now and decide what it all means.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.760
Besides, people go back and add things to stories that were finished all the time.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.640
If David Chase starts thinking tomorrow "oh, hmm,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.369
what if Tony didn't die and he moved to a different city and got a different name?" or "what if I started writing a new

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.440
fleshed-out backstory for him? Oh that's interesting."

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.960
then he gets to do that. He gets to change his ending. It's fiction,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.010
it's malleable.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.580
That's why we get to debate "is Tony dead?"

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.160
"Is Deckard a replicant?"

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.720
"Is Jar-Jar a Sith Lord?"

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:20.000
The point is that, when we say "what it means to you isn't up to anyone else", in a lot of ways,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.020
that includes the author.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.840
Reading a book is not a dialogue. With rare exception, the author doesn't even know you exist.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.140
By design, you have to do your interpretation without them.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.300
But! But...

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.200
we can't quite say an author is wholly irrelevant, either

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.500
Like, if someone handed you a page of Hamlet written out of pure chance by a chimp at a typewriter,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.420
would you try to Interpret it the same way you would the same page as written by Shakespeare?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.660
If you knew it was an animal bashing randomly at keys, would you wonder what it means

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.980
other than to ponder its sheer statistical improbability?

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:02.020
See, we try to make meaning out of something when we know there was meaning put into it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.320
The meaning of Hamlet may no longer belong to Shakespeare,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.320
but it's the existence of Shakespeare that provokes the effort of interpretation.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.040
See, the meaning of a work is an answer to the question,

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.020
"why does this exist?"

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.519
If someone made it they had to have a reason; anything from "I wanted to change the world" to

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.200
"I wanted to make money" to "I was bored".

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.740
Those aren't all great answers,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.460
but they're answers.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.220
An interpretation isn't so much about learning the "right" answers

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.700
as pondering which answers /could/ be right.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:45.820
[gentle guitar music]

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.300
When people congregate around a campfire to tell scary stories,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.500
but before the story begins,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.280
everyone is just a person.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.440
But once the story starts one person becomes a narrator and everyone else becomes an audience,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.740
and if the narrator is any good, then being an audience is easy.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.180
You may be familiar with the term "suspension of disbelief"?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.580
When the narrator tells the story, they pretend that it's true, and while the audience listens, they pretend to believe it;

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:17.560
and we often (though by no means always) consider a story to be well told if we can effectively suspend our disbelief:

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.000
if it's told in such a way that it's easy to pretend it's real.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.620
Of course you never actually believe the story,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.680
the roles of narrator and audience are just functions of the text. On the sort of unacknowledged metatextual layer,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.060
they are characters in the story: the people who believe.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.200
Which makes all of us, sitting around the campfire, in a sense,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.520
actors.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.720
The point I'm getting at here

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:47.050
is that that conversation we've been talking about? The one that gets super complicated when it's a story rather than just an anecdote told face-to-face?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.000
Stories are actually even more complicated because

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.060
they're not conversations between two real people,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.160
they're conversations between two fictional people that serve as proxies for real people.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.240
A story may be the product of one person or many individuals,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.220
but we as readers hear the story told in one authorial "voice".

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.160
We could say that voice is the narrator's voice (and when I say narrator

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.200
I'm not talking about the voice-over narration in the theatrical cut of Blade Runner or anything,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.620
I mean the mode of expression that has been deemed by the author to be the "right way" to tell this story).

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.200
And that voice doesn't just tell the story, it tells you how to listen.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.180
This is easiest to spot when it's done poorly.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.060
Like, think about a horror film where something happens that you can tell was /supposed/ to make you jump--

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.340
[woman in clip screaming]

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.380
--but it doesn't.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.233
Or, a comedy where you can tell a joke was /supposed/ to make you laugh--

00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:43.760
&gt;&gt; Woman in clip: Oh my God is that a hang nail?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.580
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: --but it doesn't;

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.040
where you can tell a plot point isn't supposed to come off as contrived--

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.410
&gt;&gt; man in clip: I think I know what's causing this

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.020
&gt;&gt; Foreground man: You do?

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.020
&gt;&gt; first man again: It's the plants!

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.220
&gt;&gt; innuendo Studios: --but it reeeeally does.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:02.400
A bum narrator is an actor flubbing their lines, or, if you prefer, a good narrator is a

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.160
dancer who knows how to lead.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.880
"So, wait," I hear you ask,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.440
"I thought you said a minute ago that a story is a conversation between one person and a text.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.440
Now you're saying it's between these two fake people? Which is it?"

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.299
Well... kinda both.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.379
When we say the reader has to construct the meaning on their own, that is

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.300
actually all of the meaning:

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.440
the imagery, the themes, the symbolism, the sights, sounds, smells, and also

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.720
the narrator and the audience.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.809
Person A may have put it all in there

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.160
but Person B still has to build it

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.800
and no two readers will build it the same way.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.169
They may hear similar authorial voices,

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.920
but they won't be exactly the same

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.780
because the people hearing them are different people.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.560
Surely you and a friend have both read the same book and come away thinking

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.000
profoundly different things about the author.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.820
People have different experiences and different tastes,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.620
so they construct different meanings,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:58.700
which means they assume different narrators as the voice behind the story, and take on the roles of different audiences.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.200
Comparing your read on the material with friends or critics is often a game of asking

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.640
"so... who did this turn you into?"

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:17.820
[gentle guitar music]

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.519
Okay, so,

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.749
piecing it all together,

00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:22.840
here's how a story gets told:

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.720
A person (we'll call them the author) has something in their head they want to express.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.920
They break that something down into its constituent elements

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.060
that then can be communicated, and they translate those elements into a language.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.169
Maybe it's the language of pictures or game mechanics or camera angles;

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:41.020
we'll use the example of a book and go with words.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.340
The words then go into the book and the book gets disseminated.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:52.280
Someone else (we'll call them the reader") reads the book and converts the words into their own set of feelings, images and sensations,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.340
and tries to put it all back together.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.460
In so doing (and to make sense of it)

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:02.920
they imagine why the author would have put these words in this order, what they would have meant with this story.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.320
That imagined author, we're calling "the narrator". The reader then wonders how the author would want them to react.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.700
That imagined reactor we're calling "the audience".

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.000
And the reader deduces the meaning of the work from the imagined conversation

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.800
between these two people.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:24.399
With skill, and with luck, the narrator is at least close to the voice the author meant to assume and

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:27.669
the audience is someone the reader is comfortable becoming for a while.

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:30.420
That's our completed conversation.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.840
It's lovely, isn't it?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.660
This is all done so reflexively that we are not often aware we're even doing it.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.960
Any discrepancies between the intended meaning and the interpretation

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.560
are simply the unavoidable and often (let's be clear) beautifully enriching side effects of such a

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.000
complex mode of communication.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.500
Now,

00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:55.040
what is that one thing I feel The Beginner's Guide has concretely to say?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.340
"Don't mistake the narrator for the author."

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.300
Taking it from the top:

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:08.060
The Beginners Guide opens with a literal narrator telling us what, if we didn't know it going in, is easy enough to verify

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.280
the game is the product of an Indie developer named Davey Wreden,

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.800
who made The Stanley Parable.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.960
The voice we hear is also a Davey Wreden who made The Stanley Parable, he even gives

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.980
us a legitimate email address.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:25.360
&gt;&gt; Davey: You can email me at [spelling] daveywreden@gmail.com

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.380
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: This invites us to proceed assuming author and narrator are one in the same.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.690
There is not yet any reason to assume otherwise.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:38.470
Davey The Narrator, early on, makes it clear that he too accepts this premise, that author and narrator are the same person.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.840
This is the basis of his analysis.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.730
&gt;&gt; Davey: This is what I like about all of Coda's games.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.999
I mean, not that they're all fascinating as games,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
but that they are all going to give us access to their creator.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.480
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: And for the first several games,

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.660
even if he is using his readings to write a narrative of Coda,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.159
they are fairly defensible readings.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:03.340
But as he goes on it seems more and more that his narrative is starting to impose itself on the readings,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.200
rather than the other way around.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.380
Coda has a number of games about prisons, which Davey The Narrator reads as evidence that Coda feels stuck in a creative rut.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.160
To Davey The Narrator, a prison can only be a trap that halts progress,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.000
because that squares with his budding narrative about Coda's restless need to move forward and seek validation.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.040
That's what he sees.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.020
He doesn't think that, maybe, to Coda, a prison is a quiet contemplative space to be alone with your thoughts;

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.360
something that might have occurred to him if he hadn't skipped the hour he was supposed to spend in one previously

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:40.900
Similarly, there's a game where players duck out of a dark night into a warmly lit house to happily busy themselves with menial tasks.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.180
The sequence then ends abruptly and players have no choice but to move toward the exit,

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.180
because as Davey The Narrator tells us,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.220
&gt;&gt; Davey: You can't stay in the dark space for too long, you just can't,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.560
you have to keep moving. It's how you stay alive.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.460
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: But, it turns out, this is another one of Davey's alterations.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.940
As far as Coda is concerned, you damn well could have just cleaned a nice house forever.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.540
So the games become as Davey sees them.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.200
The way that some readers will Ignore parts of the text in order to fit it to one of their pet theories about the author

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.300
is here literalized by changes to the game's code.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.020
Anything that doesn't fit is ignored.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:23.200
Most players will encounter this repeated three dot pattern which goes unremarked upon until the very end,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.660
because Davey The Narrator cannot figure out why it's there.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:33.660
His narrative about a need to be understood does not allow for an element that isn't meant to be understood, or maybe

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.480
doesn't mean anything at all.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.630
To an extent his assumption that Coda's games can tell us who Coda is, is right.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.540
Coda's games cannot help reveal something about the person who made them.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.309
the saying goes, "every painting is a self-portrait", and by the same token,

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.740
every story is a memoir.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.340
But what Davey The Narrator does not and cannot know for sure is

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.500
WHAT the games reveal.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:02.020
He believes Coda is unhappy, and that showing his games to other people will fix the problem.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:08.680
&gt;&gt; Davey: I brought them to people that I knew and trusted, I asked their opinion, and the great part is that they really loved his games.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.949
Can you see why I felt like this was the right thing to do?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.459
Because it's the thing that I always feel like I need: to be told that my work is good! That I am good.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.649
When- when someone really connects with a thing that I've made, when they see themselves purely in my work,

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.860
there's nothing that feels better.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.980
And I got to give that very same feeling to my friend!

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.320
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: If, for Davey The Narrator, the games are about

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:39.840
a restless need to move forward clashing with a desire for validation, fair enough. But is it just a coincidence that this narrative

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.660
perfectly mirrors his own insecurities?

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.960
The final game is where that narrative becomes untenable.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.760
This game could not be made by the Coda Davey The Narrator has imagined.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:58.320
&gt;&gt; Davey:  I remember. It's June of 2011. I'm playing this for the very first time, and as I'm playing, I'm thinking to myself,

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.750
"I don't know this person.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.819
I have no idea who this person is."

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:12.830
&gt;&gt; Innuendo Studios: For players of The Beginner's Guide, this moment, where WE realize the voice we've been hearing through the entire game is not real,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.340
is more nebulous.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.860
For some it happens near the end or shortly after finishing the game.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:25.020
Others go in assuming the story might prove to be fictional, and others still are unconvinced to this day that they aren't the same person,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.140
the irony of which I hope does not escape you.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.700
The game leaves it to us to realize what Davey The Narrator realizes:

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.740
that the narrator is not a person,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.540
just a concept.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.280
The translation of thought to work to thought is, once again,

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.390
always imperfect.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.120
We have a hand in the construction of meaning,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:51.280
so we never really know how much of what we see in the game comes from the author, and how much comes from us.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:57.840
I could hazard a guess that, after the success of The Stanley Parable, Davey Prime had a lot of thoughts and feelings

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:04.040
about the desire for validation through one's work, and those ideas may have fed into his creation of The Beginner's Guide,

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:07.300
but I've got to stop with that word "may".

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.528
On this end of the conversation

00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:10.420
I have some sure footing,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.909
but over here? I know that I know nothing.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.100
I have only what I think.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.700
Any of my assumptions could prove false, even my opening two.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.920
I'm extremely [nervous laugh] confident that they won't, but they could.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.860
The important questions are simply,

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.300
"Are the assumptions you make plausible?" and

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.840
"Do they help you make sense of the text?"

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.940
What The Beginner's Guide is NOT is a condemnation of readers hypothesizing the author's intentions,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:42.440
but rather an analysis of the necessity and inherent limitations of doing so.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.299
Coda's games, with their repeated motifs

00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:45.899
and their developing art style,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.420
BEG to be read in the context of each other,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.220
in the same way The Beginner's Guide BEGS to be read in the context of the real-life Davey Wreden, of The Stanley Parable

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.140
and of that depressing-as-shit blog.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.780
It is perfectly legitimate (in fact sometimes absolutely critical) to use the author to read the book.

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:03.720
But the road only goes one way.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.140
You don't use the book to read the author.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.760
To start imposing your conception of the narrator

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.180
onto the flesh-and-blood human being who made the text

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.320
not only takes the focus off the text itself and kneecaps your ability to fully engage with it

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.320
but can, the game suggests, be painful and psychologically damaging for that human being.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.380
That's what Davey The Narrator did to Coda, and it's framed as a betrayal.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.790
This is a common,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.080
and, I find, often frustrating mode of media criticism.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.720
I've seen people line up the works of Quentin Tarantino to "prove"

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.620
he made Inglourious Basterds because he hates his own audience.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:43.580
I've seen people line up the works of David O. Russell to "prove" that his tastes have not shifted,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.100
but that he is consciously choosing to make Oscar bait instead of his older auteurist work.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.020
Never mind the intense fixation by critics on the "secret motivations"

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.780
behind any feminist or anti-racist piece of media.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.800
And all I can wonder in these instances is: to what end?

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.560
Why so much effort put towards understanding a person the critic will never meet

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.740
and whose motivations they will never truly know?

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.900
If Tarantino hates his audience, loves his audience, wants to buy his audience a milkshake,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.300
is Inglourious Basterds not the same 154 minutes?

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:23.580
Davey The Narrator plays Coda's games with the belief that constructing a narrative about the author is the primary purpose of consuming their work.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.360
The Beginner's Guide itself presents this view in order to reject it.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.240
The guy who does this turns out to be the villain.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.920
But all that aside,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:38.480
truth be told, while I was playing it, The Beginner's Guide wasn't about storytelling or the nature of authorship.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.220
To me, that's what it's about now,

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.980
after some time thinking about it.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.740
Meaning is malleable, after all.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.040
Laura Mandanas read the game as a feminist look at how creepy dudes violate boundaries,

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.200
Liz Ryerson read it as Davey Prime attempting, and ultimately failing, to engage with his own privilege,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:00.980
and Robert Yang pondered what might drive a person to make a game as a message to another person, and wondered if he himself is Coda.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.140
There is no authoritative reading, certainly mine isn't one,

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.500
but even when these readings contradict each other, they can all in their own ways, be true.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.160
The question is only, "to what degree do we find them meaningful?"

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.060
While I was playing it, The Beginner's Guide was, to me, about the disillusion of a relationship.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.800
See, I once had a friendship like that of Davey The Narrator and Coda,

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.440
at least before the whole horrible betrayal part.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.880
That friendship was very close, and it ended very badly.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.740
While I was playing it, it was a game about how,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.849
sometimes, artists get their creativity wrapped up in their relationships

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:42.000
and start needing other people to be creative in a very specific way in order to be happy;

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.680
about how unintentionally cruel it can be to make someone else responsible for your sense of self-worth.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.399
This was a long time ago,

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:51.919
and what surprised me about The Beginner's Guide was that

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.440
it dredged a lot of those old feelings up.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.400
For a game with so many layers of irony,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.680
I had a very emotional reaction.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.920
A lot of people did.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.260
And I can't help but wonder,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.280
did the real-life Davey Wreden have a friendship go south the way mine did?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.720
And...

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.160
honestly...

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.970
who cares?

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.260
At the time, that's what the game meant to me.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.610
I get to take that with me.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.960
That's mine.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.400
And in case it's not obvious, it gave me a lot to think about.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.880
Anyway, throughout this video

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.240
I've been avoiding jargon terminology like

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:31.580
"signifier" and "enoncè" but the stuff I've been saying about "language" and "authors" and "narrators"

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.160
is "semiotics," "death of the author" and "enunciation theory".

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.760
Most of what I've said doesn't only apply to stories,

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.540
but to any creative work that needs interpreting.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.240
My discussion of critical theory is not at all comprehensive,

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.680
and maybe not all academics would agree with the way I'm mushing these schools of thought together,

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.440
but if you want to read more about any of it there are some references in the down-there part, and also check out

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.860
de Saussure,  Barthes, Foucault and  Casetti

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.320
which means... hang on

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.080
[mouse click]

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.980
[typing sounds]

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.800
[mouse click]

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.200
[resigned grunt]

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.920
If I had to end with a final thought, I guess it would be this:

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.160
the next time you hear someone wondering aloud

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.280
"Can games ever be art?"

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.340
think on the fact that I just spent half an hour making sense of this

00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:22.509
with a whole lot of this.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.610
See ya in the funny papers.
