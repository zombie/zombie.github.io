00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
About a year into the development of Portal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.240
playtesters kept giving&nbsp;
Valve very similar feedback.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.460
Something along the lines of "that was a great&nbsp;
tutorial, I can't wait to play the actual game".

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.420
*VCR Pause Sound Effect*

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.320
Uh. Slight problem. That was the actual game.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
Despite playing through 14 or so&nbsp;
hand-crafted puzzles, players were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.280
clearly missing some vital element that would&nbsp;
tell them this was, indeed, a video game.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.740
And so after a lot of discussion, Valve&nbsp;
decided that the game needed an antagonist:

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.140
someone to push back against the player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.580
to provide motivation to keep moving,&nbsp;
and to put these puzzles into context:

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.940
this was all training in order to defeat a boss.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
The end result was, of course, GLaDOS:

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.560
a loopy AI overlord with a&nbsp;
biting, passive-aggressive wit.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.680
She teases you, taunts you, tricks you.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.600
And the whole game leads up to a climactic&nbsp;
one-on-one showdown in her central chamber.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.560
GLaDOS: "Well, you found me.&nbsp;
Congratulations. Was it worth it?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.260
Because despite your violent behaviour, the only&nbsp;
thing you've managed to break so far is my heart."

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.560
Thanks to sharp writing and killer voice acting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
she has become one of the most iconic&nbsp;
video game villains of all time.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.920
But, says Valve's Robin Walker, "her&nbsp;
genesis begins with a straightforward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.940
process of us trying to solve the&nbsp;
core gameplay problem in Portal".

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.940
Now if you ask me, the fact that&nbsp;
GLaDOS may never have existed if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.200
it wasn't for this feedback goes&nbsp;
to show the value of playtesting.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
Not to be confused with quality&nbsp;
assurance - that's for rooting out bugs.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.700
Or focus testing - that's for market research.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.200
No: playtesting is simply watching&nbsp;
people play through a chunk of the game

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.710
- sometimes with a questionnaire&nbsp;
or interview at the end -

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.300
and then using what you see and hear&nbsp;
to drive changes in the game's design.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.800
For example, if Valve sees that&nbsp;
players are routinely getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.190
themselves killed when trying&nbsp;
to redirect these energy balls

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.350
- perhaps they should make a change -

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
like having it so you can only place portals on&nbsp;
walls that are way above the player's height.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.720
And so on Portal, this approach was used to&nbsp;
touch up almost every aspect of the game.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
Valve used playtesting to make sure&nbsp;
the learning curve was perfect,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.860
they used it to remove moments of frustration,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800
to make sure players noticed key objects,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.380
to improve the pacing, to tweak the difficulty,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.780
and to ensure the storyline was coherent.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.720
Playtesting even led to the game's iconic visual&nbsp;
style, with those sterile white walls and floor.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.560
Originally, the game featured&nbsp;
cluttered and grungy environments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.340
but playtesters found it hard to&nbsp;
identify the key puzzle elements.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.760
In one test, a player spent half an hour trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.420
push a shelf onto a button - while&nbsp;
completely ignoring a nearby box.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.100
Kim Swift - one of the key developers&nbsp;
on the project - calls playtesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.360
"the most important thing that we&nbsp;
learned since coming to Valve".

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.620
You see, if you didn't know, Portal&nbsp;
started life as Narbacular Drop:

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.800
a student project made at&nbsp;
Digipen University in Washington.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.060
hey were invited to show the game off at&nbsp;
Valve's headquarters and about halfway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.460
through the demo, CEO Gabe Newell stopped the&nbsp;
presentation to offer the entire team a job.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.860
Their goal was to remake the game in the source&nbsp;
engine, and within the Half-Life universe.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.080
And to help, Valve introduced the small&nbsp;
student team to its game development process.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.120
Here's how it works.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.960
You start with a goal: perhaps, in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.040
to make a puzzle that is clearly&nbsp;
readable, and satisfying to solve.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.220
You then take a stab at reaching that goal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.880
by designing something - in&nbsp;
this case, a test chamber.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.460
Next, you evaluate whether your design&nbsp;
reached that goal by doing a playtest.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.960
And if it doesn't meet the grade,&nbsp;
change the design and repeat.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.920
Valve keeps going with this&nbsp;
iterative process until it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.980
is "no longer excruciatingly painful to watch&nbsp;
the playtests", says developer David Speyrer.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.540
GLaDOS: "Fantastic! You remained&nbsp;
resolute and resourceful in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.760
atmosphere of extreme pessimism."

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300
Perhaps, given the subjects&nbsp;
of its most famous games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.000
its apt that Valve sees game development as&nbsp;
an engineering problem or a scientific study.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.640
Valve's former in-house psychologist,&nbsp;
Mike Ambinder, says "we see our game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.300
designs as hypotheses and our playtests as&nbsp;
experiments to validate these hypotheses".

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.940
Now, it should be said that playtesting&nbsp;
is by no means exclusive to Valve.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.400
And indeed, every game developer sources&nbsp;
player feedback at some point in the process.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.520
But the difference is that Valve is obsessed&nbsp;
with it, to an almost religious degree.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.800
Ambinder calls playtesting "the most important&nbsp;
part of the game development process".

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.920
Newell calls it "our secret weapon".

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.280
And a designer who joined the studio in 2018 said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.880
â€œI always heard that Valve does a lot of&nbsp;
playtesting before I came to work here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.360
and I was not prepared for the amount&nbsp;
of playtesting this company does".

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.300
Valve does playtesting early.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.000
Swift and her team started running playtests of&nbsp;
Portal after just one week of starting to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.500
the game at Valve, even though they only&nbsp;
had one half-finished room to show people.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.180
And then do it often.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.180
Portal was playtested practically every week.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.420
They'd do a playtest on Friday,&nbsp;
discuss the results on Monday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.800
apply the lessons the rest of the&nbsp;
week, and test again on Friday.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.960
It sounds extreme.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.340
But I think this devotion to playtesting&nbsp;
makes a lot more sense when you learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.440
about the disastrous development of&nbsp;
Valve's very first game, Half-Life.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.400
About two months before&nbsp;
Half-Life was supposed to ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.480
Valve realised that the game... well, sucked.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.560
The developer said "you couldn't play the&nbsp;
game all the way through, none of the levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.580
tied together well, and there were serious&nbsp;
technical problems with most of the game.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.460
As a whole the game just wasn't working."

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.800
The only real option on the table was to&nbsp;
scrap the whole thing and start from scratch.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.060
But this time, they would do things&nbsp;
differently - which lead to two game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.120
development philosophies that are&nbsp;
still present in the studio today.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.520
One is the idea of the cabal: where&nbsp;
the staff is split up into tiny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.960
multi-disciplined teams who each take complete&nbsp;
ownership of a small chunk of the game.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520
But the other is frequent playtesting, from&nbsp;
the very earliest point of development.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.780
This time, if the game sucked,&nbsp;
they wanted to know right away.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.420
So, about three months into development of the&nbsp;
restarted Half-Life, they started playtesting.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.120
They found random gamers in video game shops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.100
and contacted people who filled in those little&nbsp;
registration cards you got in old PC boxes.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.220
They'd sit them down in front of&nbsp;
the game and just watch them play.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.820
Each test would result in dozens&nbsp;
of things that needed to be fixed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.340
changed, added, or deleted from the game.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.560
Like, after watching some playtesters break&nbsp;
every crate in a level, Valve realised it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.880
probably needed to stuff some of those boxes&nbsp;
with goodies like ammo and health packs.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.640
And this new process obviously worked: this&nbsp;
version of Half-Life was a huge success,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.020
and is now seen as one of the most&nbsp;
important and influential games ever made.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.360
And, as such, Valve would use playtesting&nbsp;
extensively in all of its future games.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.700
On Half-Life 2, Valve planned to give out&nbsp;
the gravity gun towards the end of the game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.260
but players loved using it so much, the team&nbsp;
decided to make it available much sooner.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.460
On Left 4 Dead, playtesters found it hard&nbsp;
to find teammates who were in trouble,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.700
which led to the x-ray outlines&nbsp;
of your fellow survivors.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.980
And on Portal 2, a paint type that&nbsp;
let you walk on walls was scrapped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.680
when it made multiple playtesters feel queasy.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.120
The arrival of Steam allowed Valve&nbsp;
to go further - converting millions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.120
of online players into post-launch playtesters.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.440
When Steam's data showed that lots of&nbsp;
players were getting stuck in Episode One,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.280
they released a patch to reduce the&nbsp;
difficulty of a tricky siege battle.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.840
Plus, playtesting was instrumental&nbsp;
when exploring an all-new technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.240
virtual reality, for Half-Life: Alyx.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.160
For instance, Valve learned that a player's&nbsp;
tolerance for standing around watching people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.140
talk was significantly lower in virtual&nbsp;
reality, so had to speed up the game's pace.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.480
"Player behaviour helped us navigate VR&nbsp;
development," says Valve's Christine Phelan.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.220
"You could almost think of the player as another&nbsp;
designer. There is barely a moment in the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.260
that wasn't improved by what playtesters told&nbsp;
us and showed us through their play behaviour".

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.280
So, from Half-Life 1 to Half-Life: Alyx,&nbsp;
playtesting has been an invaluable tool for Valve.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.200
So I want to share some tips from the developers,&nbsp;
to show you how to playtest more effectively.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.760
Though it should be stated: Valve&nbsp;
is not like other companies.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.500
From its unorthodox organisational&nbsp;
structure to its near infinite resources,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.220
there are very few companies on&nbsp;
Earth who can copy what Valve does.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:09.420
And also: this approach may work best on super&nbsp;
linear, extremely hand-crafted story games

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.880
- and other techniques, like heat maps,&nbsp;
may work better for other types of game.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.400
But, with those caveats out of the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.820
perhaps their experience can still&nbsp;
provide some useful guidance.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.480
So, tip number one is test early.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.240
Valve says "playtesting is where we make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.720
the vast majority of our most&nbsp;
important changes to our game.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.220
So we try to do it as early as possible on&nbsp;
the project, to get the most value out of it."

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.300
When you identify a problem early&nbsp;
on, you have time to go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.180
the drawing board and develop an&nbsp;
effective solution to the problem.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.880
But do it too late, and sometimes the only way to&nbsp;
fix a problem is with a flimsy band-aid solution.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.860
Like, uh, I dunno, having the characters just&nbsp;
tell you the solution to a crummy puzzle.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.020
Valve may start testing within a few days of&nbsp;
prototyping a mechanic or designing a level.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.240
Even if it looks hideously ugly, with programmer&nbsp;
art or bright orange textures on all the walls.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.140
But this actually helps them avoid&nbsp;
wasting time on other aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.460
there's no point investing heavily&nbsp;
in art or audio if the game mechanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.400
is gonna be completely changed&nbsp;
- or cut from the game entirely.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.160
Number two is test often.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.680
Valve typically tests every single week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.740
to make sure that they are constantly&nbsp;
iterating on player feedback.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.860
This also leads to a huge amount of data.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.120
Each Half-Life 2 chapter had about&nbsp;
100 playtesters, for example.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.300
And that mass of information can be invaluable.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.560
By having a huge number of people look&nbsp;
at the game, Valve can look for common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.360
trends in the feedback, and avoid tweaking&nbsp;
the game based on a few weird outliers.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.840
And the more experience you have seeing&nbsp;
people interact with your designs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.840
the better you'll get at preempting&nbsp;
this feedback in the future.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.880
Gabe Newell says "after you've watched a couple&nbsp;
hundred playtests, you start to develop a much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.900
better sense of what are successful&nbsp;
and unsuccessful design strategies".

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.680
So, some famous lessons learnt&nbsp;
at Valve include "players don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.380
learn when stressed" and "players don't look up".

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.320
Number three is shut up and watch.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.180
A playtest should try to simulate the&nbsp;
actual experience of playing the game.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.200
Which means the observers need to stay&nbsp;
quiet for the duration of the test:

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.800
no hints, no guidance, no&nbsp;
answers to burning questions.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.020
"Nothing is quite so humbling as being forced&nbsp;
to watch in silence as some poor playtester&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.880
stumbles around your level for 20 minutes,&nbsp;
unable to figure out the 'obvious' answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.100
that you now realise is completely arbitrary and&nbsp;
impossible to figure out", the studio has said.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.700
Post-game interviews and&nbsp;
questionnaires can certainly happen

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.570
- those were instrumental in solving&nbsp;
the GLaDOS problem after all -

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.320
but you'll often learn more by watching&nbsp;
players than by talking to them.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.340
Swift says "they may tell you later&nbsp;
that they like the game but you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.300
really tell by their body language whether&nbsp;
or not they actually enjoyed themselves".

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.240
It's also a common game design trope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.020
playtesters like to offer potential&nbsp;
solutions to the problems they face

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.220
- but as they don't have insider&nbsp;
knowledge of your vision or constraints,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.280
those solutions are usually better left ignored.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.120
Number four is designers should run playtests.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.640
Valve does not outsource testing to a special&nbsp;
department or leave it with a publisher:

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.240
playtesting is done by the people&nbsp;
who are actually responsible for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.320
design and execution of the&nbsp;
level or mechanic in question.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.240
The cabal, from earlier.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.300
This shows the developers&nbsp;
exactly what needs fixing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.300
and can give much-needed&nbsp;
motivation to improve the game.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.760
And player behaviour might inspire new puzzle&nbsp;
solutions or ideas for the designers watching.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.320
Like, in Half-Life Alyx, players would&nbsp;
instinctively cover their real-life mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.120
to stop Alyx from coughing, and alerting&nbsp;
a gigantic blind zombie named Jeff.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.320
So Valve turned covering your&nbsp;
mouth into an actual game mechanic.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.140
Number five is get the right people.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.340
Valve gets feedback from a huge&nbsp;
variety of different playtesters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.580
from fellow staff members to&nbsp;
little kids to pro gamers.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.960
But its learned to always have a target&nbsp;
audience in mind when making changes.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.760
Like, when Valve was figuring out how to&nbsp;
make a climactic boss fight against GLaDOS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.820
they initially got feedback&nbsp;
from hardcore FPS players,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.180
who said the level needed more action,&nbsp;
more challenge, and more skill.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.580
But that idea was a dud:

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.180
when facing this tricky boss&nbsp;
fight, says Erik Wolpaw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.960
"the vast majority of playtesters who&nbsp;
had gotten used to the slower-paced,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.760
cerebral nature of Portal were just&nbsp;
frustrated, confused, and dissatisfied".

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.180
They still wanted to satisfy&nbsp;
those hardcore FPS players,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.220
but did so through optional content, like&nbsp;
Portal's advanced chambers and challenge maps.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.400
Number six is to challenge your assumptions.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.780
Okay, so maybe the GLaDOS boss fight&nbsp;
didn't need to be a test of skill.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.280
So, perhaps it needed to be the most&nbsp;
complex puzzle in the entire game?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.680
Surely that would be a suitable climax.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.820
But, here's the thing - playtesters&nbsp;
thought the game's mid-point escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.360
that bit where you use a portal to&nbsp;
avoid falling into a pit of fire

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.260
- players thought that was&nbsp;
incredibly climactic and satisfying.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.860
Even though it's basically&nbsp;
the easiest puzzle in Portal.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.400
But Valve realised the time&nbsp;
pressure, the visual impact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.000
and the high drama all made it&nbsp;
way more exciting to players.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.180
So maybe they were overthinking&nbsp;
the final boss, too.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.500
"We've been holding on to this idea that&nbsp;
we need a complex puzzle at the end and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.940
it simply wasn't true", says Swift, and so&nbsp;
they settled on a pretty simple sequence.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:35.040
It's very easy for game designers to make&nbsp;
wonky assumptions about how players will act

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.240
- I recently made a whole video about&nbsp;
doing this in my own puzzle game.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.480
I'll drop a link to that one in&nbsp;
the end screen of this video.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.540
Perhaps the most important tip, though,&nbsp;
is that playtesting feedback is just data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.580
and it's up to the designer how that data&nbsp;
is interpreted, filtered, and applied.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.320
For example, Half-Life 2 originally&nbsp;
had a very short introduction before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.780
Gordon Freeman grabbed a gun and started shooting.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.580
Playtesters loved it.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.040
Who wouldn't be excited when&nbsp;
jumping into the action?

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.960
And so, given this good feedback, it would be&nbsp;
easy to keep the game exactly like that.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.080
But, despite the positive sentiment, writer&nbsp;
Marc Laidlaw says Valve decided to keep working.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.780
They thought it would be better to delay combat.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.920
"We wanted you to witness the cops doing&nbsp;
something horrible, and feel like what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.660
were doing was a response to that - not that&nbsp;
you were just a killing machine," says Laidlaw.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.020
And they thought it would lead to&nbsp;
a better emotional pay-off if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.640
had to wait a much longer time before&nbsp;
finally getting Gordon's iconic crowbar.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.560
BARNEY: "Oh, and before I forget. I think&nbsp;
you dropped this back in Black Mesa.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.900
Good luck out there, buddy."

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.160
Here's the thing: playtesting&nbsp;
is as useful as you make it.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.380
If you just bend the game to the whims and&nbsp;
desires of every playtester who comes through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.540
you'll end up with a dumbed-down game,&nbsp;
or bland, design-by-committee sludge.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.940
But if you go in with a clear goal.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.080
A specific game you want to make, for a&nbsp;
specific audience you want to entertain.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.100
And then use playtesting to validate&nbsp;
whether you are hitting that goal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.540
you can use feedback to unlock the&nbsp;
incredible game you are trying to make.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.040
Oh, don't click off.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.400
I've got one last Portal story&nbsp;
while the Patreon credits roll.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:23.520
So, the invention of GlaDOS is actually not&nbsp;
the most dramatic change that Valve has made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.140
in response to player feedback.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.520
During an internal game jam, held&nbsp;
shortly after the release of Portal 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.320
a bunch of Valve developers came up with&nbsp;
an experimental puzzle game called F-Stop.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.220
In this game, you use a camera&nbsp;
to take photos of objects.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.320
Then, you can spawn that object elsewhere in the world&nbsp;
- perhaps at a completely different scale.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.360
Gabe Newell loved the concept, and said it&nbsp;
should be developed as a follow-up to Portal

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.520
- meaning each game in the series would feature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.100
a different piece of technology&nbsp;
developed at Aperture Science.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.400
But, after nearly a year of development,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:04.200
playtesters were very vocal in their feedback:&nbsp;
Portal without portals just didn't work.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.600
And so Valve decided to scrap the game&nbsp;
and start Portal 2 all over again.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.860
In recent years, we've been able to&nbsp;
see what F-Stop might have looked like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.500
as fans have used leaked assets and code&nbsp;
to make various recreations of the game.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.140
But Valve never returned to the concept.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.240
If you want to play something similar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.340
check out Superliminal, or wait for the&nbsp;
upcoming photography puzzler, Viewfinder.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.480
Thanks for watching.
