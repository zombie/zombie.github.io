00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a tomato.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.120
You with me so far?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.440
A tomato is a fruit, by which I mean, it is the seed bearing part of a fruiting plant.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.320
I know that sounds redundant, and if you ask a botanist,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.560
they'll give you a much more complicated answer,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.200
but for our purposes, that's the definition of a fruit.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.280
It's the plant part that has seeds in it, and has evolved to be enticing to eat, so that animals will take it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.000
and then drop, spit, or crap the seeds somewhere, and grow a new tree/bush/vine/whatever.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.000
That's what fruits do. And that's what tomatoes do, so, as far as Botany is concerned, a tomato is a fruit.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080
And so are avocados, pumpkins, and peppers.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.800
But we, as human beings who eat fruit, aren't so concerned with the lifecycles of fruiting plants.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.000
What matters to us is usually:

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.240
"What does it taste like?"

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.500
"How do I cook with it?"

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.120
"What does it pair with?"

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.080
And since many of the fruits we consume are sweet, and are often used to make up desserts,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.860
while tomatoes are savory, and tend to make up part of the body of an actual meal,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.180
we tend to think of them as vegetables.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.360
And for our day-to-day lives as people who just want something to put on our fettuccine,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.360
these culinary definitions of "fruit" and "vegetable" are more useful, more practical, than the botanical ones.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.800
Especially when the botanical definition of "vegetable" is basically non-existent.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.760
So, in terms of actual usage, a tomato has two definitions: botanical and culinary.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.840
A description of what it scientifically is,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.780
and one of what it culturally means.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.580
But what a tomato means depends on who you're talking to.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.380
Whether a tomato feels like a vegetable will vary

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.480
from person to person,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.640
from culture to culture,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.760
from era to era.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.400
For instance, my dad will hold a tomato in his hand and eat it bite by bite, like an apple.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.560
So, if to me a tomato is a fruit,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440
it doesn't mean it has to be one to you.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.620
But, if to you it's a vegetable, you maybe shouldn't argue that position

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.100
with a botanist.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.680
Botanically, there is no question as to whether a tomato is a fruit,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.600
because unless something new has been discovered about plant biology,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000
the definition is rigid.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.540
It's built on science and consensus;

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.140
there is nothing to debate.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.360
Culinarily, there is no question as to whether a tomato is a vegetable,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.540
because whether it tastes like a fruit or a vegetable

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.340
is entirely subjective.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340
No one opinion is any righter than any other,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.200
so there's nothing to debate.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920
And when some snotty fourteen-year-old says over dinner,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.900
"A tomato is a fruit, actually",

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.000
They are creating a debate where none was necessary.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.220
It's possible you didn't know a tomato is, scientifically speaking, a fruit,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.840
but it's just as possible you did know, and the kid knows you know,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.280
and you're within your rights to say,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.740
"Stop arguing across definitions, kid,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.820
you're being a ding-dong".

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.960
It's important to recognize that both these definitions matter for different reasons.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.420
And we avoid trouble so long as we know, when we talk about tomatoes, which context we are speaking in.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.360
Now, maybe you've figured this out already,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.420
but this is not a tomato.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.000
It's a metaphor.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.980
We often find ourselves having these

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.780
dinner table "debates" that are almost arguments and don't need to be either,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400
when we discuss words that are more meaningful, and more abstract than

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.260
"tomato".

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.340
Words like "game" as in,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
"Is Proteus really a game?"

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.100
Words like "indie" as in,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.720
"Is Saddle Creek really an indie label?"

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.360
And, of course, one of the biggest three-letter words in English:

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.940
Art.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.940
When speaking about science fiction, author Damon Knight's frequently paraphrased definition of the genre is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.140
(and I am myself paraphrasing now)

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.280
Science fiction is what we point to when we say "Science fiction"

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.100
Meaning, if I tell you "I'm reading this great Sci-Fi novel",

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.780
and you say, "Sci-Fi? You mean like Star Trek?"

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.780
and I say, "Yeah, Sci-Fi, like Star Trek,"

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.500
we can proceed to talk about the novel without confusion.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.050
We don't need to know what makes the novel Science fiction to know that it is Science fiction.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.200
We just need to know that Star Trek is Sci-Fi,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.020
and this is like Star Trek,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.920
so by substitution, this is Science fiction.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.040
And this is how we operate with much of culture. We don't often have definitions,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.840
we have points of reference.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.420
But if we have widespread agreement about what those points of reference are,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.240
and we have a pretty good understanding of what the experience of those points of reference is,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.000
we can talk about huge swathes of human endeavour without needing things to be defined.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.960
It's only when someone offers up a thing that doesn't feel like it belongs that we run into conflict.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.280
When someone offers up for discussion a work of art

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.640
that does not feel to you like it should be called art,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.960
then we have the "What is art?" argument.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.520
Throughout the history of modern art, we have pretty much never stopped having this argument.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.660
Whether it's today, with "Are video games art?", or before that,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.040
"Is performance art art?",

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.460
and "Is abstract painting painting?",

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.240
and "Is free verse poetry poetry?"

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.840
Someone says, "Leaves of Grass doesn't rhyme, but it's poetry because it feels like poetry."

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.060
And someone else says, "But it doesn't feel like poetry,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.540
it feels like grandiose prose where someone kept hitting the carriage return at random points in a run-on sentence."

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.660
And the only way to articulate why something does or does not feel like art

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.940
is to give language to what has until now simply been a set of gut feelings

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.680
we thought everyone agreed on.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.180
These are the fumbling conversations in which people offer up their own culinary definitions

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.420
and each insist that theirs is the one true botanical one,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.300
generally assuming that they are authorities on the subject.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.200
So, you might then ask me,  "What, then, is the "botanical" definition of art?"

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.500
Are there any authorities who can provide us with rigid,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.340
peer-reviewed classifications for what is and is not art

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.320
like astronomers determine what is and is not a planet?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.380
Anyone at the table who can put what it is to rest so we can speak freely about what it means to us?

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.700
Well...

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.760
No.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.560
...but kind of.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.920
Look, definitions come in a few flavors. Some are quite rigid.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.600
A prime number is just fundamentally different from other numbers.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.060
A number is either divisible by only itself and one,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.800
or it isn't.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.580
They are an innate feature of the universe, and upon discovering them the definition was self-evident.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.120
We got that one for free. On the other hand, the definition of, say,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.060
"planet" is not innate.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.660
A planet is a planet

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.440
simply because we say so.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.060
We look at the natural world and we divide its contents into categories

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.040
because it helps us understand what we're looking at.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.340
And while there is a logic to this, it is also always, to some degree or another, arbitrary.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.280
Pluto stopped being a planet because the more we understood about the solar system,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.840
the more thinking of Pluto as a planet made shit weird.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.300
So, we changed how we thought about it.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.740
Now, if a prime number is a natural thing with a natural meaning,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.000
and a planet is a natural thing with a cultural meaning,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.720
art is a third flavor.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.940
It is a cultural thing with a cultural meaning. By which I mean

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.280
the definition of art is a human invention,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.740
and so is art itself.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.720
When we started calling it a dwarf planet, Pluto did not change.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.060
It's the same lumpy space rock it ever was.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.260
But if the definition of art changes over time

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.220
(and it has),

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000
then the art changes also.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.460
When we think about art differently, we start making it differently.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.060
So trying to define it becomes like trying to hit a moving target from the back of a moving horse.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.540
This softness on both sides means that the science of our scientific definition for art

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.160
is not going to be the hard science we think of astronomy and mathematics as being,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.720
but a social science, like anthropology, or linguistics.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.380
Art doesn't come with a user's manual.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.160
All we can do is look at the way it is made,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.080
and the way it is talked about,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.900
and try to spot the patterns.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.400
This doesn't mean there are no governing principles, just that they are a bit harder to pin down.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.340
Many people in the art world have offered up workable definitions of art, and some are pretty defensible.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.040
But if you're looking for a universally accepted definition of what makes art art,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.919
I don't think one exists.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.220
But there are some generally accepted qualities of art

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.360
that anyone who works in art history,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.520
art curation,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.660
or art theory is going to be familiar with.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.400
We may not know what the one true definition is, but we have determined some things about it.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.600
For example: (and yes, I am bringing this up)

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.900
Take Roger Ebert's proclamation that video games are not art.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.580
An argument that was, seemingly unbeknownst to him, very, very, old.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.600
See, Ebert didn't just say video games aren't art.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.400
He said they are not, and can never be art.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.360
And that's not just a bad argument,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.180
it's an argument that has been bad for a hundred years.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.000
Around the time that a dude named Duchamp signed a fake name on a urinal and called that art,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.780
We had a conversation about what is, and isn't art.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.700
We had it over dinner tables,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.320
and we had it in publications.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.720
And the opinion that won out and became foundational for the following century of modern art

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.080
is that while not everything humans do is art,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.300
there is nothing humans do that can't be art given the proper context.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.820
That's how a blank canvas,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.020
or a soup can,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.320
or 50,000 nickels with matches stuck to them

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.660
can end up in a museum alongside Rembrandt and Hokusai.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.760
None of us individually have to call them art, if calling them art doesn't make them meaningful to us,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.460
but it's worth acknowledging that much of the work we do find meaningful

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.340
would not exist without the art world's accepted belief

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.220
that nothing can't be art.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.340
I've noticed that when someone says,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.540
"This is not art",

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.320
whatever the "this" is, it's usually something the speaker either dismisses,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.960
or something they care about a great deal.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.500
But they don't seem very invested in the "art".

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.220
Because they often make these kinds of arguments.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.980
Ones that would be a lot harder to make had they ever taken an art history class,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.740
or even just typed "art" into Wikipedia.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.100
It seems a lot of people don't view art as a practice associated with a sizable body of theory,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.020
they see it as a label. A status symbol.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.920
And they don't want to see that status applied in places that don't feel appropriate to them.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.940
These conversations have been going for centuries.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.020
It's always fascinating to me when someone at the dinner table starts one from scratch

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.340
and figures they'll have it all sorted out by dessert.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.100
Now, I'm not saying that we should leave the art discussions to the experts--

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.180
I don't do the appeal to authority.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.200
It's not like you have to be a botanist to talk about plants.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.240
But it is somewhat foolish to argue about Botany when one doesn't actually care about Botany.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.520
If one doesn't actually care what the definition of vegetable is, they just like telling folks a tomato isn't one.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.720
I think the discussion of what art is

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.700
and the discussion of what a given work means to us

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.500
are both incredibly valuable, so long as we remember

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.760
that they are two different conversations.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.760
And since I would hope no one actually wants such a discussion to spiral into an argument,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.520
I think it's most important to reflect when we begin to speak,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.700
on which discussion we're trying to have.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.260
When we talk tomatoes, are we talking about biology?

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.900
Or are we talking about

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.440
taste.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.880
Then we can have the conversation we presumably set out to have,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.960
which is rarely

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.940
"is this art?",

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.820
but rather,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.320
"is this good?"

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.800
So that's why you might hear me compare this or that debate about art to a debate about tomatoes.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.040
That's the metaphor. Everybody follow?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.700
Cool.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.440
'Cause I fucking hate tomatoes.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:46.340
