00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
So there’s this story about the novelists
Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
attending a party together, by the way
good morning Hank it’s Tuesday.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.240
The party’s an extremely lavish affair
hosted by a billionaire and Vonnegut

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.560
says to Heller, “Joe isn’t it funny that
our host makes more money in a day

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.800
than you ever made from your beloved
bestselling novel Catch 22?” and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Heller is like “yeah that is funny,
but I have something our host will

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.360
never have.” And Vonnegut says
“what’s that?” and Heller says, “enough.”

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.560
I’ve used this story for years to
remind myself that I have enough,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.160
but also to remind me that most
people on Earth do not have

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.760
enough. Many people do not have
enough food, or enough clean water,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.000
and most people do not have enough
savings or enough to access

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.960
excellent medical care. But in my
experience, even those of us who

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.440
do have enough, often feel as if we
don’t. There’s always something missing,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.640
more security, or power, or money
that stands between us and true

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.320
enough-ness. For me it’s always
been about security. The feeling I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.360
am trying to avoid all the time is
precarity, the feeling of being close

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.840
to the edge and not having a say
in whether I go over it. But of course,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.760
having adequate distance from
precarity turns out to be, one,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.000
impossible, and two, insofar as it
is possible, actually a pretty

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.560
terrible idea. Let’s start with
why it’s impossible.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.560
Wealth and privilege insulate people
from many kinds of precarity in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.320
profoundly unjust ways and I
think that is important to acknowledge,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.280
but ultimately there is no getting
around the big precarity which is that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.280
I love and everyone I love will die.
When I was young I thought I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
could solve this problem by writing
books that would last, books that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
would survive even though I wouldn’t.
But I eventually realized that is of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.200
course a fool’s errand. Books also
don’t live forever and anyway, that’s

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.360
not why books exist. They exist to be
helpful to the people who find them.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.040
And then my next idea was that even
if my work couldn’t last, my legacy

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.600
could through philanthropy, like I would
build up this huge charitable trust

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.440
and then once it was really big, it
would start donating 5% of its

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.000
resources per year or whatever to create
charities and then my impact would

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.920
stretch through the years. The problem
with this strategy is that I was still

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.080
trying to maintain some kind of
control or agency that would survive

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.320
even after my body didn’t, right?
Also I was conveniently forgetting

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.480
the fact that if you donate money now,
it’s true that it no longer grows under

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.280
your control, but it still grows. It grows
in the form of more kids surviving

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200
to adulthood, and more people having
educational opportunities and so on.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.080
And that growth is actually much
more transformational and important

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.080
than like the appreciation of stocks.
Now I want to be clear that I insulate

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.680
myself from precarity in as many
ways as possible, like I quit smoking

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.720
20 years ago because it was making
my life more precarious, I have

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.960
insurance to make life less precarious,
and I have financial security which

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.200
makes a billion things less stressful
and more possible from taking

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880
professional risks, to getting my
kids any support they need.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.640
And of course it’s human, wonderfully
human, to try to protect those we

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.680
love, there’s nothing wrong with that.
But one thing I have noticed over

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.680
the years is that when rich people
only spend time with other rich people,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.240
they do not feel rich, they feel normal.
And this arrives at what I really don’t

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.560
like about the people who have
enough, it is so easy to forget that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.800
we have enough. In fact, let me
stop using “we” and start using “I.”

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.600
I forget that I have enough because
in trying to insulate myself from precarity

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.160
I can also make myself distanced
from the reality of suffering. And if I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.640
was more proximal to that suffering,
I would use more of my resources to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.680
try and alleviate it. And too often trying
to insulate myself and those I love from

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.960
the realities of suffering, I am also
looking away from injustice and inequity

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.920
and impoverishment. And if having
enough means having enough to not

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.720
have to face those realities, then
enough is simply too much.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.440
Hank, I’ll see you on Friday.
