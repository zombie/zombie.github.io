00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.011
The way the work week works is the worst.

00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:04.411
Waking up on Monday, you've got

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.286
five days in a row of work or school.

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:08.533
It's too much.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.286
For, but by Wednesday,

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:13.013
withered is your soul with two more days,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.040
nay three more days, until the weekend.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.273
But, alas.

00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:19.273
The weekend is also broken.

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:21.533
Two is the wrong number of days off.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.253
Because the first day off is just a collapse

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.086
from the overly long work week

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:27.253
and the second day off

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:29.706
is tainted by the looming Monday.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:33.513
The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient.

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:36.526
It takes three days off just to <i>feel</i> like two days off.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.213
And two days off feels like one day off.

00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:41.166
But here is where it gets interesting.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.953
Because one day off isn't none-day-off.

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:46.660
A day off never goes unappreciated.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.340
Which brings me to a new schedule for new living:

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.006
Weekend Wednesday!

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:52.546
Take the last three work days,

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.226
slide them over one slot,

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.380
and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.160
Now, when you wake up on Monday

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.060
there's only two days to go until Weekend Wednesday,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.406
then just three more days 'til Sunday.

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:05.753
I've been working on this schedule,

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.033
and <i>boy</i> do I love it!

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.566
Here are the advantages.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.720
Productivity goes down without breaks.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.526
That's true on the scale of a day

00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:14.840
to the scale of a year

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.773
(or a life)

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:18.393
and it's certainly true on the scale of a week.

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:21.440
Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
A two day push, followed by a break

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.586
then a three day push

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:25.146
and rest

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:27.520
feels amazing on both cycles.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.166
The days off are more relaxing

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.140
and the days on more concentrated.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.653
If you're self-employed with control over your schedule,

00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:36.513
or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.013
I <i>strongly</i> suggest you give it a try.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.406
And if you're an employer

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:44.080
your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.760
it's worth considering if everyone is on board.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.620
Now, of course, Weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.660
and that's fine.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.353
Better even, because that creates an

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:54.946
off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it.

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:57.566
Having a free day when everyone else is working

00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:02.006
makes <i>so many things</i> easier and faster and crowd-less.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.086
As for the Saturday,

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.506
you now have time to wrap up the work week

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:07.993
without interruptions from the rest of the world,

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.846
leaving Sunday as a true day of rest.

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:13.700
So that's the glory of Weekend Wednesday!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.326
More frequent days off that feel 100%.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:18.680
More concentrated and shorter work sprints

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.953
with a bonus off cycle advantage.

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.506
If those sounds intriguing, why not give it a try

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:26.573
and see if Weekend Wednesday works for you.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:44.566
