[super cool music like "Damn this is some stylish sh*t"]

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.390
- I am "The Portrait of Madame
X" by John Singer Sargent.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.337
I was first exhibited in 1884,

00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:20.010
and I caused quite a stir in Paris

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.830
because although my artist intended for me

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.540
to be a study in light and
shade, audiences and critics

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.290
thought I was trying to
be sexually provocative.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.463
So, which is it?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
What does the artwork mean?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, you might be sitting
there thinking, "Well,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.090
it's subjective, there's
no right or wrong answer!"

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
but I am willing to bet that
you don't really believe that.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.080
There's a big difference
between saying that the quality

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.820
of an artwork is subjective
and the meaning is subjective.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.220
If you don't like The
Portrait of Madame X"

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.190
then fair enough, I guess
I'm not to everyone's taste.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.930
And I suppose when I pose for it,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.420
it's more like "The Portrait of Madame XY,"

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.950
but is it really the case
that I can be about anything?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.800
If somebody says to you, I
just saw "Doctor Strange 2".

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.270
And you go, "Oh yeah, what's it about?"

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
And they say, "It's about how
love has an everlasting value,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.580
even between two people of
different social classes

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.233
on a doomed ocean liner."

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.340
You'd be like, "No, that's Titanic."

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.991
It definitely seems like you
can look at a work of art,

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:30.540
think you know what
it's about and be wrong,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
which means the meaning at
least is not subjective.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
So assuming artworks do
have objective meaning,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.820
how do we find out what the meaning is?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.343
If I don't get it, how do I get it?

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:50.400

I'm pledging a couple of dollars a month

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.403
to keep the show going.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.220
These paintings are some
of the most famous examples

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.650
of modern art in the world.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.073
And I have absolutely
no idea what they mean.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:25.928
[gentle music like "Hmm yes the art here is made of art"]

00:02:25.928 --> 00:02:28.610
They're called the Seagram murals.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.540
They were painted in the 1950s

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.390
by American artist Mark Rothko.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.250
Originally, he was
commissioned to make them

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.380
for an upscale restaurant in New York.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.760
But when he actually visited the place

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.343
he changed his mind and
gave the money back.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.310
The paintings are still displayed

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.650
in accordance with his intentions:

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.620
close to the ground in a small room,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.883
with off-white walls
in low, even lighting.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.123
Rothko said he wanted
audiences to feel trapped.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.380
If I want to get it, maybe
those facts are a clue.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.430
If somebody tells me Rothko's paintings

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.160
are about being happy and
having a nice time at the beach,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
I can point to his intentions
and go, no, you're wrong!

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.140
'Cause I don't wanna get it wrong.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.820
I don't wanna misinterpret something,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.590
that could be really awkward.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.170
Like when your friend who
you thought was straight

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.920
sends you a bunch of flirty
messages and you're like, "Babe,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.660
is there something you need to tell me?"

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.830
And she goes, "What?!

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.097
No, I'm definitely straight,
definitely interested in... men.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.803
Everybody sends messages like that, right?"

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:48.186
[Leezy's "Girls Like You" plays]

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.250
Some philosophers have said

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.610
that the meaning of an
artwork is part of it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.970
albeit not a part that
you can see with your eyes.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.250
Take for instance, "Fountain",

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.920
one of the most famous works of art ever.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.890
It was presented in 1917 by Marcel Duchamp

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.080
and it's what's called a readymade,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.750
a sculpture that was already made

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.900
because it's just an ordinary urinal.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.700
He bought it from a shop.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.130
To the eyes, "Fountain" is identical

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.830
to other urinals that are not art.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.303
So, the argument goes,

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:24.990
what makes it different is its meaning.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.110
If you don't get that
meaning, you have in a sense

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.860
failed to experience the
artwork that is "Fountain".

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.600
You've just seen a urinal.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.500
Funnily enough, I have
some artwork with me today

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.730
that is about this very
question. (Interpreting art,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.500
not whether your friend
is flirting with you.)

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.780
Although actually kind of both!

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.410
This is "Pale Fire" by Vladimir Nabokov.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.500
One of the most famous
novels of the 20th century.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.500
The story is that the poet,
John Shade, has been murdered

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.650
on the night that he
completed his greatest work.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.650
So the poem has been
published posthumously

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.750
by his good friend, Charles,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.380
with notes explaining its meaning.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.380
But as we read on, Charles'
notes get weirder and weirder.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.930
He starts claiming that
certain words in the poem

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.430
are really a coded message

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.930
about how John was in love with him

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.490
but his wife wouldn't let him say it,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.520
and really, the poem is all about Charles,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.960
until he's talking about things

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.120
that are completely unconnected

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.890
and we're like, "Hang on a
minute... did he murder John?!"

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.230
A lot of the humour comes from the fact

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.040
that Charles' interpretation
of the poem is wrong.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.675
He says it's about one thing, it obviously isn't, 
and that's why it's funny,

00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:47.794
but how do we know he's wrong?

00:05:47.794 --> 00:05:53.070
Well, it would be very helpful if we could just ask John
what his poem is about.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.170
And indeed, some philosophers have said,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.450
the way you find out an artwork's meaning

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.810
is you look at the artist's intention.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.700
If it seems like your
friend is flirting with you

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.420
but it's kind of ambiguous,
just ask her how she feels!

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.760
But it doesn't really
help us with "Pale Fire"

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.840
because the whole setup

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.330
is that John Shade has been murdered.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.950
We don't know what he intended.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.760
Maybe Charles is right and
the poem really is about him.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.400
And this problem comes
up a lot in art history.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.440
We have evidence of what
artists like Rothko and Duchamp

00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:26.460
intended for their works, but
often that isn't the case,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.710
especially if the art is very old.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.990
And even if we could go back

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.930
and reconstruct an artist's intention,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.060
it might not be a very secure foundation

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.060
on which to base an
interpretation of their work.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.980
The French philosopher Michel Foucault

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.297
pointed out that the author of a text

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:47.520
is sometimes a bit of a vague
construct, even a brand.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.040
Basically, our reconstruction

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.770
would kindof be an
interpretation as well.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.590
As Charles shows us,
it's perfectly possible

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.010
to imagine an idea of
somebody in your head

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.620
who supports your
interpretation of their work,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.350
but who isn't that
close to the real thing.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.649
Maybe your friend is flirting with you,

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.540
but maybe you're just projecting

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.712
because secretly, you kindof want her to.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:17.370

[Also, Leezy, I emailed your management about licensing this track and they never replied??? I think technically I don't have to cause it's only 10s but I wanted to anyway cause I like your music - get in touch and let me pay you!]

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.880
The risk is that we just end
up repeating what other people

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.430
have told us about the
artists' intentions,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.350
regurgitating the marketing

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.350
rather than actually engaging
with what they've made.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.757
That's why the philosopher
Roland Barthes said

00:07:30.757 --> 00:07:32.640
we should forget about the author

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.590
and just focus on the text

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.270
In his famous essay, "Death
of the Author", which yeah,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.020
John is dead, so I guess you
got what you wanted there.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.440
Roland Barthes, where were you

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.690
on the night that John Shade was murdered?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.600
Just to make things even more hazy,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.065
the British artist
historian Michael Baxandall

00:07:54.065 --> 00:07:56.280
said that artists don't really have

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.420
intentions for their work the
same way that an architect

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.250
has an intention for a bridge.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.660
When you design a bridge,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.580
you plan it all out beforehand

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.130
and you have a very clear goal in mind,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.010
but art doesn't really work that way.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.410
Every brushstroke you add to a canvas,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.980
every line to a script,
every note to a score,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.730
changes the relationships
between everything else

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.630
and changes the whole.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.700
As you work, your intention develops.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.687
So if we're trying to reconstruct
the artist's intention,

00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:31.290
where do we start?

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.940
There isn't really one intention.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.340
There's an infinite sequence of them.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.250
John Singer Sergeant
took almost a whole year

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.290
to finish "The Portrait of Madame X,"

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.749
and he tried a lot of different poses

00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:44.133
before he settled on the final thing.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.000
Rothko took years to
finish the Seagram murals

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.990
and he changed his mind

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.550
about what he wanted to do with them.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.470
As somebody who is a working artist,

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.730
I can tell you from experience

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.920
that intentions absolutely change.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.040
I recently finished writing a play.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.130
It's gonna be on in London
soon. It's called "The Prince".

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.750
I'm really, really excited for it!

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.270
Tickets available in the doobleydoo
if you're interested!

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.570
When I started it I
intended to write something

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.970
about the monarchy, but the more I worked

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.320
the more I realised it actually needed

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.760
to be about something
completely different,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.310
and the final product has
almost nothing to do with that.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.430
So if we try to reconstruct
my original intention

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.420
to decide what the play is
about, how is that gonna work?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.680
It definitely seems like
you can be wrong about art,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.000
but I'm still not clear

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.433
on how you can make sure you're right.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.602
I am "The Portrait of Madame
X" by John Singer Sergeant,

00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:38.854
am I a study in light and shade?

00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:41.490
Or am I a sexual scandal?

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.087
[Multiple voices] I have suggestion!

00:09:43.087 --> 00:09:48.087
Maybe you need a
different angle on things!

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.046
[upbeat music like "Whoa cool we're changing it up, sick!"]

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.890
I am Pablo Picasso's paintings,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.260
all of them, viewed at the same time

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.650
from different angles!
'Cause that's cubism baby!

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.990
Some people think that I
am the greatest artworks

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.340
of the 20th century.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.930
A lot of people look at me
and they go, "I don't get it."

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.920
And my suggestion is, don't focus too much

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.740
on the intellectual stuff,
or you might miss out

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.050
on what the art really has to offer!

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.270
The philosopher Susan Sontag

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.870
says we should stop
trying to interpret art,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.670
stop trying to get it
and just experience it.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.080
Like Duchamp's "Fountain".

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.420
Everybody says, "Oh,
he's making a statement

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.790
about the art world!" and
Picasso's paintings,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.550
everyone says, "Oh, he's
asking the big questions,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.550
like... what if there was a
really f*****d up looking woman?"

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.520
But art isn't a statement or a question.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.980
If it was, the artist
would just write it down.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.760
Art isn't philosophy
with pictures, it's art!

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.760
So turn off Brain and tune in
to the aesthetic experience!

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.400
I sometimes feel a little
bit like that with my videos.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.200
Sometimes people comment and they're like,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.360
"Can you just make a list
of all your major points

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.090
and read them out without
all of the extra stuff?"

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.790
And I'm like...  "No."
[giggles]

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:17.400
Sometimes art is supposed to be difficult to get.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.897
For example, I have another novel here::

00:11:19.897 --> 00:11:23.460
"What It Feels Like For
a Girl" by Paris Lees.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.100
Full disclosure, Paris is
one of my best friends,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.930
but I liked her novel before we met.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.700
It's about a kid called Byron

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.320
who grows up on a council estate

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.870
in the Midlands and has
a really rough time.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.641
And the whole thing is written

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.610
in the dialect of that region.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.930
If you're not from

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.692
that specific geographic
and socioeconomic place,

00:11:43.692 --> 00:11:46.080
it is sometimes hard to interpret.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.080
And that's a good thing because,
spoilers, Byron is trans,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.460
which is also never explained.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.560
There's never a scene where
like a doctor turns up

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.990
and explains to the audience
what trans people are

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.330
and confirms that Byron is one.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.668
The reader's struggle
to interpret the text

00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:05.880
parallels Byron's own
struggle to just live,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.120
free of the interpretations
other people push on them.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.660
The challenge to the reader
is, even if you don't 100%

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.430
understand this person, can
you still feel for them?

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.150
So in a way, if you 100% got it,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.597
you'd almost be missing out!

00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:26.850
"Interpretation is the revenge
of the intellect upon art.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.530
Even more, it is the revenge

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.540
of the intellect upon the world.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.760
To interpret is to impoverish,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.370
to deplete the world in order to set up

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.590
a shadow world of meanings.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.400
Real art has the capacity
to make us nervous.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.457
Interpretation makes art
manageable, conformable."

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.758
I think we can really get
to grips with this idea

00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:52.530
by looking at the work of
modern American playwright

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.842
David Mamet, who is a little bit of a problematic fave of mine.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:13:01.842
In 2009, Mamet wrote a play called "Race".

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.130
The story is, content
warning, a wealthy white man

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.600
has been accused of raping
a young black woman.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.090
The whole thing is set in the offices

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.628
of his defence lawyers,
as they try to invent

00:13:18.628 --> 00:13:22.560
some way of getting him off the hook.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.871
The witnesses say that
they heard sex noises

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:29.820
and racial slurs being shouted.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.820
So the defense they concoct
is that she was into that.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.263
The whole thing was actually consensual 
and she's just lying to get his money.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.145
The slimiest possible thing!

00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:46.940
But as the play goes on,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.710
it starts to emerge

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.610
that maybe that really
is what's happening.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.390
Maybe there really is some
kind of reverse racism,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.960
reverse Me Too thing happening here.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.690
And Mamet loves to write
these kinds of stories.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.280
He did another play called "Oleanna",

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.500
which is about a female
student who falsely accuses

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.450
her professor of sexually assaulting her.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.660
But then... he really does!

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.440
He loves to write these Tim
Pool-ass thought experiments.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.930
If you tried to take "Race"

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.250
and translate it into
a political statement,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.930
the statement that you get

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.260
would probably be a little bit incoherent.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.540
And I'm not just saying that
because I personally disagree

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.740
with Mamet's politics.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.870
In his book "Theater",

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.450
he occasionally talks
about his political views

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.800
and it contradicts itself
from chapter to chapter.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.380
The stuff about theatre
is really interesting.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.200
The stuff about politics kind of reads

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.830
a little bit like discount
Jordan Peterson, and fair enough!

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.140
Man's a playwright, not
a political scientist!

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.131
But I saw "Race" on Broadway in 2010

00:14:57.131 --> 00:15:00.360
and it was electric.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.820
The performance was so good

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.830
that when I came out of the
theater, I was like, "That's it,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.470
I have to be an actress." And years later,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.390
I did a monologue from "Race"

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.260
at my drama school
auditions, and I got in.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.293
Mamet says that if you are writing a play,

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:20.460
creating a work of art for the
stage, forget about politics,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.370
forget about interpretations
and meaning and getting it

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.970
and all of that [jackoff noises]
Is it entertaining?

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.980
Do the audience wanna
know what happens next?

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.270
If you're singing in
front of a work of art

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.430
and you're trying to get
it, then you're a fool.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.748
The play, the story, that's
the thing that we're here for.

00:15:35.748 --> 00:15:38.520
As somebody who's just
finished writing a play

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.310
and is going to be in it
soon, there have been times

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.860
where I've found that to
be really useful advice.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.620
In fairness, I'm white,
so when I watch "Race,"

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.210
I can turn off the bit of my brain

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.800
that worries about the politics stuff.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.630
Maybe someday David
Mamet will write a play

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.520
about trans people and
I won't have the luxury

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.960
of being entertained anymore,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.450
but for now, let's take
this idea and run with it.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.790
Forget about trying to interpret the art.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.923
Just... how do you feel?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.547
When I look at Rothko, I feel... uh...

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.300
It's big, it's black, it's maroon, it's red.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.120
It's, uh...

00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:18.792
I feel humbled.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:25.247
I feel in awe, I feel sad.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.320
You know that feeling
where something bad happens,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.110
but you kind of knew it was going to,

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.620
like when somebody tells you
they don't love you anymore

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.750
and you kind of saw it coming,

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.010
or you're at a funeral
and the person's died,

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.263
but they've been ill
for a really long time.

00:16:45.263 --> 00:16:56.004
And it's like, well, it's sad,
but at least it's done now.

00:16:56.004 --> 00:16:58.533
That's kind of how Rothko makes me feel.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.170
Or at least that is part of it.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.633
But there might be a
bit of a problem here.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.400
Truth be told, whenever
I'm in an art gallery,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.918
I always feel low key anxious

00:17:13.918 --> 00:17:17.502
because I used to date an art historian.

00:17:17.502 --> 00:17:20.310
And we would sometimes
go to galleries together.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.220
We're talking ancient history
now, years and years ago,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.200
but that relationship ended pretty badly

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.420
for reasons that were my fault.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.610
So now whenever I'm in an art gallery,

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.243
I'm always like, "What if she's here?"

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:37.020
[Kim Petras' "Reminds Me" plays]

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.410
My point is, people
feel all sorts of things

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.510
when they look at art.

00:17:42.507 --> 00:17:44.070
Sometimes I look at Rothko and
I feel anxious about my ex.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.240
Sometimes I look at Rothko

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.210
and I feel like suddenly I have to pee.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.903
So which feelings are the right ones?

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.890
Even if I'm just focusing
on my emotional reactions,

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.540
how do I know that I've got it?

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.780
We can probably narrow
it down a little bit.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.797
Like we could say that your
feelings should be caused

00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:06.870
by the particular artwork
you're looking at.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.750
Yes, I might look at Rothko
and feel anxious about my ex,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.940
but that's not caused by Rothko.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.640
Any painting in any gallery would do that.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.800
I might look at it and feel
that I have to pee, but again,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.920
that's not caused by the
Rothko, that's just coincidence.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.090
But even then, that might not be enough.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.220
Whenever I look at the Seagram murals,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.407
I think about "Spider-Man 2."

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.190
The story of how Rothko made
them was adapted into a play

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.350
called "Red", which starred Alfred Molina,

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.510
who played Dr. Octopus
in "Spider-Man 2".

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.850
I really liked Alfred
Molina's performance in "Red".

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.660
So now whenever I look at
those particular paintings,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.820
there's a part of me that feels happy, 'cause I'm like,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.570
"Oh yeah... Alfred Molina!"

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.940
- There's a huge amount of input

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.950
and a whole new vibe really.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.390
- My feelings are caused
by that specific painting

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.770
and they don't seem
relevant to its meaning,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.860
but then we are right
back where we started!

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.071
It really seems like the
artwork has a correct meaning

00:19:09.071 --> 00:19:12.180
that determines whether or not I get it.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.560
And you might be like, "Well,
okay, but what did Rothko feel?"

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.560
He probably wasn't feeling
anything to do with Alfred Molina

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560
or my ex-girlfriend... probably... 
But the despair,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.010
the sadness, the trappedness, yeah, maybe.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.660
I mean, he did say that
he felt those things

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.100
when he wrote about the paintings.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.690
So maybe that's it.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.230
Maybe if I stand in front of
them and I feel the same thing

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.240
that the artist felt when he made it,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.921
that means I've got it!
But hang on a minute,

00:19:41.921 --> 00:19:44.970
we've already tried this.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.960
Remember a minute ago,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.970
we learned about how
the artist's intention

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.901
can be a tricky concept
because intentions change

00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:53.580
over time and the artists themself

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.190
might be just another interpretation?

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.500
How do I know I'm not doing the same thing

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.840
with Rothko's feelings?

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.990
In "Pale Fire", John Shade
obviously felt a lot of things,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.850
but how do we know whether or not Charles

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.350
picked up on the right ones?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.470
In my play, there are
like nine characters

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.590
some of whom feel things that
I've never felt in real life.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.103
So what is the audience supposed to feel?

00:20:18.106 --> 00:20:20.223
I am Pablo Picasso's paintings.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.123
How do you feel about me?

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.893
[Hidden voice]
Here's an idea!

Leonardo "The Big Dog" da Vinci.

by Saudi Arabian ruler

Mohammed bin Salman for $450,312,500,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.550
which makes me, oh my gosh!

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.900
I guess that makes me the
most valuable painting in the world!

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.230
 in the world!

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.100
or how people feel, not the
art world, that's for sure.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.370
Salvator Mundi is a portrait of Jesus,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.490
a man who famously did
not have a high opinion

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.483
of rich people.

[USSR National Anthem plays]

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:22.470
But that didn't matter because art

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.210
is what economists call an asset
or in poor people language,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.360
it's a way to avoid paying taxes.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.920
Let me give you some advice, okay.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.010
This is now Salvator's
business influencer tips,

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.680
buy cheap paintings.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.513
And when I say cheap,

00:21:38.513 --> 00:21:41.670
I mean like rich people cheap
like $25,000, that's nothing.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.940
Take those cheap
paintings to an appraiser,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.370
one that you trust and say, "Hey Jimmy,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.230
how much would you say
this painting is worth?"

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.790
And Jimmy goes, "Oh, I don't
know, maybe a million dollars."

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.670
And then what you do is
donate that work of art

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.560
to a charitable foundation,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.420
preferably one that you control.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.210
Oh, but Salvi, I hear you
say, why am I giving it away?

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.440
Why am I not selling it?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.170
Well, because as far as the
tax collectors are concerned,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.230
you just donated a million
dollars to charity my friend,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.360
you're practically a saint!

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.960
So use it for clout! And more importantly, it's a tax writeoff!

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.680
Or try it this way around.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.480
Let's say you already own a painting.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.870
And it's very valuable - 
like me! But not me.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.740
Obviously, you couldn't afford me. I'm Jesus Christ Superstar!

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.350
Take that valuable painting to your appraiser and say,

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.110
"Hey Jimmy, how much would
you say this one is worth?"

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.821
And Jimmy says, "Oh, I don't know. Not much I reckon."

00:22:38.821 --> 00:22:40.803
Then what you do is you die.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.060
The method is up to you there.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.840
But when you go, donate
that valuable painting

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.430
to your spoiled rich kids,

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.759
to Ferdinand and Jemima and Armancio,

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:56.100
they then sell it.

already avoided inheritance tax.

You can look down proudly from heaven, 
where rich people definitely go.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.640
The art market is pretty unregulated,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.210
pretty opaque and very concentrated.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.590
And if you have the
millions it takes to buy in,

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.330
there are millions of ways
you can stack the deck.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.820
Whilst the plebs are
standing in front of the work

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.618
trying to figure out what it means,

00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:35.130
you already know what it means.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.860
It means you never have to work again!

Huge vibe.

- Except, well, it's hard
to be completely cynical.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.500
Even in the ritziest of ritzy art circles,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.380
people do still talk about the meaning.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.070
In the early noughties, a
new art movement developed,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.480
that came to be known as Zombie Formalism.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.900
Pretty quickly, people started to suspect

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.900
that zombie formalism was just
trying to make a quick buck.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.830
A lot of the paintings themselves

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.960
were pretty visually neutral

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.620
so you could hang them in a
CEO's office or a fancy lobby

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.460
and they'd take up space
without pulling too much focus.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.870
Some of them pushed boundaries,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.200
but in ways that didn't always
seem significant like, oh,

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.790
it's the first painting ever to be done

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.083
with a fire extinguisher.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.890
Great.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.829
And a lot of them got flipped:

00:24:33.829 --> 00:24:36.600
bought cheap first time round,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.440
sold very expensive on
the secondary market.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.890
These examples are the
"Seven Rain Paintings"

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.000
by Lucien Smith,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.580
one of the most prominent
zombie formalists,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.752
and they made him very rich.

00:24:49.752 --> 00:24:52.890
When they were exhibited in LA,

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.287
they were accompanied by this description.

00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:59.790
"Smith's work acts as a tangible moment,

he negotiates with existence,

he reminds us that an artist's trajectory is a 
[nonsense babbling]"

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.013
What?

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.200
I don't even remember what that said.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.080
Those words just slid off my brain.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.727
That that was pure bullsh*t.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.700
And yeah, a lot of philosophers

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.550
and art critics actually
said that at the time

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.830
or words to that effect.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.380
Interestingly, Lucien Smith himself

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.837
has since come forward
and kindof admitted it!

00:25:34.837 --> 00:25:37.620
"The model that was set
for me when I was younger,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.540
it wasn't a healthy model.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.760
It was about sucking up to
collectors and trying to sell

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.080
for the highest prices.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.610
That stuff isn't real, that's not art."

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.990
According to his website,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.010
Smith is now living in
New York, making NFTs

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.197
for a company called Lobus, which... 

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.740
if somebody had accused
me of making worthless art

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.540
just so that it could be sold to fools

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.972
to make a lot of money,

00:26:04.972 --> 00:26:08.910
I probably wouldn't get into crypto, man.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.090
But even at its most cynical,

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:16.230
people still had to act
like the art had meaning.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.350
Part of the process of building
hype around a new artist

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.850
is convincing people that their work

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.710
has something interesting to say.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.510
And zombie formalism didn't last in part

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.430
because audiences and
critics saw through it.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.960
Other trends took its place,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.690
including a trend for what
you might call woke art

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.230
or art with social and political meaning.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.856
Yes, it's a financial asset,
but people still want to stand

00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:44.673
in front of a painting
and feel like they get it.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.693
And I still do, with Rothko.

00:26:50.527 --> 00:27:03.677
[chill synth music like "Hmmm, thoughtful."

00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:08.160
It's tricky because there is
kindof a cultural pressure

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.570
with art, especially modern
art, to act like you get it.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.040
And I know that there are some people

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.480
who respond to that pressure

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.880
by just denying that modern
art can have meaning.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.620
They're like, "Oh, nobody really gets it.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.750
Nobody really likes it,
they just pretend to!"

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.570
and that's always seemed
kindof cynical to me.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.850
But at the same time, I
do feel that pressure.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.870
Like I feel like I should have
opinions about Mark Rothko.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.690
I should be that kind of cultured person.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.763
But I guess if that's
how I'm approaching it,

00:27:35.763 --> 00:27:38.250
then I'm not really engaging with the art.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.110
I'm just worried about the kind of person

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.240
that I feel I should be.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.520
Like, "Oh, what if I get invited to a party

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.140
and I say the wrong
thing about Mark Rothko

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.030
and I make a fool of myself?"

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.860
But that's a silly way to approach it.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.870
Because even if I got everything

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.755
there was to get about Rothko,

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:56.550
there's thousands of other artists here

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.550
that would confront me
with that same anxiety.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.680
If you come to art looking for a stick

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.740
to beat yourself with, then
you're probably gonna find it.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.544
So maybe we should ask
a different question,

00:28:06.544 --> 00:28:11.544
which is, what is the
point of trying to get it?

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.790
When I was a child, we studied "Macbeth"

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.380
in English class.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.220
If you don't know it,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:27.120
it's about a guy who murders
the king and steals the throne.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.590
And there's a running theme
in the play about clothing.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.790
People say that Macbeth

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.979
is wearing somebody else's clothes

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.670
as a metaphor for him stealing the crown.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.430
They say that his new
title doesn't fit him.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.260
"It hangs loose about him like a giant's robe 
upon a dwarfish thief."

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.630
Macbeth is all about the drip.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.940
and I, being a little wise ass,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.750
put up my hand and said,
"Miss, did Shakespeare

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.960
really intend to put that in there?"

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.740
And there's two ways of
asking that question.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.650
The first is, did the actual man,

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.830
William Shakespeare,
actually sit down in 1606

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.600
and have the thought,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.143
"I am going to use a clothing
metaphor in my new play.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.090
And then I'm gonna send a bunch
of flirty sonnets to someone

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.720
and make them wonder whether I'm bisexual."

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.400
[Saint Motel's "Just My Type" plays]

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.520
There's no way we can know
whether he thought that

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.860
without a time machine and a mind reader.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.100
But the second way of
asking the question is,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.397
do we get more out of the play

00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:39.397
if we assume that the
clothing metaphor is intended,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.280
do we enjoy it more?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.693
Does it prompt us to some
interesting reflections

00:29:43.693 --> 00:29:47.970
if we assume that we
are meant to notice it?

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.550
if we just go, nah,
that's just a coincidence.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.720
Don't worry about it.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.640
Then are we missing out?

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.410
The philosopher Alan Goldman

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.296
says that the point of interpreting art

00:29:57.296 --> 00:30:02.296
 is to maximise its artistic value.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.160
Now what exactly is artistic value?

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.363
Well, maybe that's another
story for another time,

00:30:07.363 --> 00:30:12.363
but his point is that getting
it is not a competition.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.580
It's not about being right.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.440
But then how do we know that Charles

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.845
is wrong about "Pale Fire"?

00:30:18.845 --> 00:30:23.043
Because if he's right
then the poem isn't good.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.550
John Shade leaves behind
this amazing work.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.730
He writes about being an old
man at the end of his life

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.220
and what it was like to lose his daughter

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.250
and it's really, really moving.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.590
If we assume, as Charles does, that, oh,

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.970
that stuff doesn't matter,
it's really all about him,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.533
well then it's kind of a waste.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.610
That's what makes Charles
a tragic character.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.930
He's so lost in his own
mess that he can't see

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.410
the true value of what John has made.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.240
As for me and Rothko, I
can try to put together

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.700
all the different ideas
that we've looked at today.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.740
I can bear in mind what Susan Sontag said

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.380
about not intellectualising
things too much.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.620
I can remember that the process
by which art gets exhibited

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.050
is often a financial thing
rather than an arbiter

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.380
of its meaning, so I don't
have to feel pressured by that.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.380
And I can also try to think
about what Rothko himself

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.610
might have intended or felt,

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.375
not so I can reconstruct his brain,

00:31:22.375 --> 00:31:27.360
but so I can see whether I
can also feel those things.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.153
I'm looking for new experiences
when I go to his art,

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:33.099
I'm trying to grow and develop

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:37.233
as a person, rather than trying to get it.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.971
As I've been writing my play,

00:31:40.971 --> 00:31:43.769
I've had to deal with a
lot of these questions

00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:46.080
and be in the room with actors

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.630
as they try to interpret the characters

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.490
that I have written.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:51.750
By the time you're watching this,

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.250
rehearsals will already have started.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.960
I know that a lot of
you already have tickets

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.110
and I cannot wait to share
"The Prince" with you.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.330
I am so, so excited.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:04.140
It is a dream come true
to be able to make art.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.220
And I just wanted to say thank
you to all of you basically,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.230
because without Philosophy Tube

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.330
I'd never have been able to do this.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.500
And I also wanted to make sure

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.110
that even if you can't come
to London and see it live,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.610
you can still experience it.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.120
So there's a streaming
service called Nebula

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.620
where you'll be able to watch

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.860
a professional recording of the play.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.930
Unlike YouTube, Nebula doesn't have ads

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.030
or algorithms or demonetization,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:34.620
it's owned by the creators
who work on it, like me.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.770
So it's a place where we
can put the experimental,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.603
unusual stuff

00:32:39.768 --> 00:32:41.760
that wouldn't work here
on YouTube, like my play.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.040
And also like the behind
the scenes documentary

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.800
that the Philosophy Tube
crew made last year

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.930
about how this show comes together.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.980
Fans of Philosophy Tube can
get a special deal on Nebula.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.843
If you sign up to Curiosity
Stream using my special link,

00:32:56.843 --> 00:32:59.250
curiositystream.com/philosophytube,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.260
you get Nebula as well.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.260
So for $15 a year, not
a month, $15 a year,

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.010
you get everything on Nebula

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.410
and everything on Curiosity Stream,

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.110
including this little
documentary about what happened

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.930
to Picasso's estate after he died.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.220
It's a fascinating little insight

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.710
into the finances of the art world.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.660
Considering that you can get both Nebula

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.230
and Curiosity Stream
for a year for like less

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.217
than what Netflix costs a month,

00:33:27.217 --> 00:33:30.180
I think that's a pretty sweet deal

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.056
and you'll also be helping
me bring my dream to life

00:33:34.056 --> 00:33:37.110
on a professional London stage.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.690
So go to
curiositystream.com/philosophytube

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.460
and sign up for the bundle today.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:46.460
And I will see you very,
very soon at the theatre!

00:33:46.460 --> 00:34:00.208
["Blood" by Anima plays]

00:34:00.208 --> 00:34:13.671
[REALLY happy with this episode! So pleased!]

00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:26.163
[I feel like the pacing really works for this one with four parts, which is cool cause the 4th one was invented on the day!]

00:34:26.163 --> 00:34:43.894
[The original plan was to go back to the Picasso look for the final section but Brian, the Philosophy Tube stylist, brought all these extra clothes to the set]

00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:57.357
[And I was like Oh awesome let's use them then! Worked really well that the last section was about clothing]

00:34:57.357 --> 00:35:10.932
[Anyway, rehearsals for The Prince have started and oh my gosh, I love this cast so much!]

00:35:10.932 --> 00:35:23.461
[If you haven't already got tickets then I really would recommend moving fast, they're selling quickly!]

00:35:23.461 --> 00:35:42.312
[Over half the performances are sold out already, which is incredible considering we've been in rehearsals for like a week]

00:35:42.312 --> 00:35:57.410
[I wish I could tell you more about it cause it is just so awesome but you'll have to wait and see!]

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:16.883
[And if you can't get tickets then signing up to Nebula really will help, they'll see that and it means other streaming services might be more inclined to let me make stuff for them in future!]

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:38.809
[Everyone involved is just so nice as well? And so talented!]

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:52.496
[Also I sent the latest version to the publisher yesterday, it's going to be actually published as a book!]

00:36:52.496 --> 00:37:10.016
[Not bad not bad! Published playwright!]

00:37:10.016 --> 00:37:23.479
[I seem to have a lot of friends who are writers? Not just Paris but I have a few friends who are novelists, successful ones too!]

00:37:23.479 --> 00:37:42.629
[Gosh I'm so lucky to have all these talented clever people in my life!]

00:37:42.629 --> 00:37:54.148
[Did you like the bits where I geeked out about theatre too lol?]

00:37:54.148 --> 00:37:55.333
HUGE VIBE
