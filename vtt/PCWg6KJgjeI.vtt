00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.140
Do not avert your eyes.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.700
That's what's coming at us.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.980
This is what a collective anonymous body of majority wants to see on television.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
I think about this quote a lot from Werner Herzog.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.740
He was talking about television, and specifically Wrestle Mania, but

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.320
I think it it applies to any form of popular entertainment.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.020
The basic idea is that the most popular things,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.215
the biggest movies and TV shows and even digital media

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.655
are a reflection of what we want to see,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.880
so we can read from them insights about our desires and aversions.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.820
As professor John Hunter from Bucknell pointed out recently in a TEDx talk, which I'll link below,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.860
our tentpole movies aren't entertaining by accident.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.800
If you're investing in something that costs anywhere from 200 million to 300 million dollars,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960
you aren't taking any chances.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.320
Every second of these films and TV shows is scrutinized by editors

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.160
and photographers and directors

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.540
and producers and marketing people and studio executives,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.820
and it is designed to cater to our desires, to your desires to be as popular as possible

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.720
to as many people as possible.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.040
Hunter argues that what our biggest movies tell us is that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.320
we're not interested in seeing reality as it is.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.260
We prefer worlds that are animated or in a galaxy far far away.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.120
We prefer a universe populated with superheroes,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
or an island populated by dinosaurs

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.820
or a super advanced kingdom hidden away in the jungle.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.320
Now to be fair, popular entertainment has always had an escapist element,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.520
though you could say that it's more prominent now than in the past.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.880
But what I find more interesting about Hunter's argument is a specific aversion

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.980
that he finds in the entertainment of today.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.680
The resentment of our...

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.520
smartphones.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.220
Those ever-present things that connect us to social media

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.080
and capture more and more of our free time every year.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.180
If we look at our most popular movies, he says,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.560
What we don't see, is our devices

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360
I immediately became interested in the truth of this claim,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.480
so I decided to take a closer look at the highest domestic grossing movies of this year, 2018

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.995
to see if smartphones were in them,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.380
and if they were, how exactly they were being used.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.580
Okay, first in Black Panther, America's highest grossing movie in 2018 (and likely to stay that way),

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.755
There are three brief instances of smartphone use.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.340
First, by Linda. You guys remember Linda, right?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.080
She uses her phone to intercept security footage.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.460
Then we see a couple shots of people taking pictures of T'Challa after a chase sequence

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.860
Then Claw uses one to text someone later in the film, though we don't see who or know why.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.500
In Avengers: Infinity War, there are exactly zero smartphones. None.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.660
However, Tony Stark, the most technologically advanced human on the planet,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.440
who wears a suit made of nanoparticles,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.560
does use a phone in the movie.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.880
It just looks like this.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.980
In the third highest grossing movie of 2018, The Incredibles 2,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.235
There are also zero smartphones,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.200
having to do with the fact that the world has this mid-century, modern aesthetic

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.520
even though there are some high tech things...

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520
it's confusing...

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.940
Like Infinity War however, there is no shortage of older phones.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.420
In Jurrassic World: Fallen Kingdom,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.720
We get our first look at a major character using a smartphone for something other than communication,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.385
and we actually see what she's looking at

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:22.940
Claire is reading the news.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.000
though it's brief and the other three instances of smartphone use in this movie are all phone calls.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.140
In Deadpool 2, we get one phone call,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.180
one mindless surf from Yukio,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.980
and this homage to "Say Anything".

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.960
In Mission:Impossible â€“ Fallout,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.700
Ethan Hunt, the "Linda" of these movies,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.820
Repurposes a smartphone to use it as a tracker,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.680
twice.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.280
There is one FaceTime call,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.200
and one, uh, phone handoff.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.920
In Ant-Man and the Wasp, there is just one FaceTime call

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320
and one regular call.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200
And finally in Solo,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.320
There are no smartphones at all,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.860
because this is a far-futured galaxy, that's set in the past,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.620
that has what George Lucas thought future things would look like 40 years ago.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.300
All together that's 16 smartphones in the top 8 grossing films of 2018.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.060
(I couldn't get access to 9 and 10 because they're still out in theatres,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.440
but I think this is a good sample.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.840
The uses breakdown like this:

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.700
Five phone calls, two video calls,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.000
four what I'll call single-use spy stuff

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.040
one news source, two camera, two unknown, Claw and Yukio,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.700
and one "Say Anything" homage.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.140
If we're trying to determine the truth of Professor Hunter's claim,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.460
that the lack of smartphones is indicative of a popular resentment

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.500
toward the way these devices control our lives and eat up our free time,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.035
we should compare the way that people use smartphones in these movies

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.860
to the way that we do.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.900
Through that lens, we can see that at least five of these uses have little or no relationship to real life,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.720
unless you're a spy, that is.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.620
Phone calls, similarly, are an activity that can just as easily be done on Tony Stark's flip phone

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.460
or Mr. Incredible's cordless.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.500
That leaves only six uses:

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.000
video calls are I don't think something that most of us worry about when it comes to time wasting,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.580
same for taking photos.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.300
And as for Yukio and Claw, we don't even see what they're doing.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.020
That leaves this single instance of Claire checking the news.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.840
Now, for me at least,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.740
that is definitely a common time-sucking use of my smartphone.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.340
In the end, you can decide for  yourself whether this evidence is conclusive.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.760
I think there is enough here to at least partially support Hunter's claims,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.900
because though there are smartphones in some of these movies,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.820
their combined runtime comes out to only about a minute, if that,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.440
and I don't think we really see anyone using them in the ways we might be frustrated with

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.820
in our, on average, 3.3 hours of mobile usage a day.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.640
And I'm more convinced when I realize that

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.180
in all of these films,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.200
there are no references or mentions at all of social media.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.060
According to the data company "Apptopia",

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.400
across the hundred most popular apps, 54% of screen time is spent in apps owned by Google or Facebook.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.980
That's things like Youtube, Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.995
None of these apps, or any generic equivalents,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.960
appear in the highest grossing movies of 2018.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.740
The time-wasting, data-mining, addiction-creating activity

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.640
that has become a key, maybe even a defining feature, of our relationship with these devices

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.340
is absent from our most popular entertainment.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.640
Now this doesn't mean that our smartphones and social media don't feature in any movies.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.540
In fact, one of the best movies of this year in my opinion, Bo Burnham's "Eighth Grade",

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.320
is all about the ways that our devices and the social internet shape the way we interact.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.080
Confronting that relationship is, and will be, an important subject for film.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.520
But our most popular movies have never really been about confronting our fears and resentments,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.520
They're about escaping them

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.420
for about a couple hours at the end of a hard week,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.420
and in that spirit, I think you can say that smartphones may play a big role in our lives,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.640
bigger maybe than we want to admit,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.540
but they barely have any part in our biggest movies.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.340
Hey everybody thank you so much for watching.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.480
