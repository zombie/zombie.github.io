00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.210
 A few weeks ago, a work by
British street artist Banksy

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.490
went up for auction
at Sotheby's London.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.740
Moments after the
auctioneer banged his gavel

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.770
announcing its sale
for over $1.3 million,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.530
a beep sounded and
the canvas began

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.600
to fall through the
bottom of the frame

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.060
and emerge in shreds
on the other side

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.670
just after Banksy
posted a picture of it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.070
with the caption
going, going, gone

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.930
and then followed up
with a video showing

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.600
how he installed a shredder
in the frame in case

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.009
it ever went up for auction.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.110
Sotheby's claimed
they had no idea

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.320
that this was going to
happen and had been Banksyed.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.170
And the buyer was anonymous,
which is common in auctions.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.090
After a week when
media conjecture had

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.940
run dry over who knew about
it and would the buyer have

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.130
to pay for it, Sotheby's
put out a press

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.440
release explaining that
what actually happened

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.020
was that a new work by
Banksy had been created

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.620
at the auction, one that's been
authenticated by the artist

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.080
and given the new title
"Love is in the Bin".

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.320
After that, Banksy released a
director's cut explaining that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.860
in rehearsals, the paintings
shredded fully every time,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
including some vertical video
to firmly place the rehearsals

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.430
in the recent past, proving both
that he's a master manipulator

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.680
and that his word
cannot be trusted.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.490
OK, but let's take a closer look
at what this work actually is.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.190
Banksy first painted the
image of a child reaching out

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.970
toward a red, heart-shaped
balloon in London in 2002,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.700
this one with the inscription
"There is always hope."

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.740
Other versions were
made around the city,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.810
but none of the
original murals remain

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.150
because this, like
most of Banksy's work,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.120
was unsanctioned street
art made without permission

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.150
for the public to enjoy and
for property owners or city

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.210
government to paint over
or protect as they see fit.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.660
Individuals can and have
tried to remove and resell

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.550
his public art, but
for the most part

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.460
Banksy's work has
been fleeting and free

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.790
and is actively planned to
be that way by its creator.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790
The heart balloon
appeared alone in 2013

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.910
with bandages in Brooklyn
and also with kids standing

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.410
on a pile of guns at a Central
Park art stall on sale for $60.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.430
In 2014, he reworked the girl
with balloon image in supported

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.130
the With Syria
campaign, explaining,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.740
"The red balloon carries
the girl above and away

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.830
from the chaos below, beyond
the burnt-out buildings

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.480
and bullet-potted walls."

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.160
Also in 2014, Justin Bieber had
the image tattooed on his arm.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.020
A version with a
Union Jack balloon

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.020
surfaced in 2017
in a print Banksy

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.920
tried to give away to UK
citizens in some constituencies

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.380
if they voted against
the Conservative Party.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.740
But since it's illegal to accept
a gift in return for a vote,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.200
the offer was rescinded.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.550
And a few days later
he posted this.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.920
In a 2017 poll,
"Girl with Balloon"

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.790
beat out both this painting
by JMW Turner and this one

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.950
by David Hockney
to claim the title

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.270
of the UK's favorite artwork.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.810
This is all to say that by
the time the work in question

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.960
arrived at auction it was
a well-loved and widely

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.230
recognizable image,
estimated to sell for as much

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.730
as about $400,000 US.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.430
The auction report
shares that it's not

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.830
a multiple but a
unique work made

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370
in 2006 with Banksy's signature
method of stenciled spray

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.730
paint but this time on
canvas instead of on a wall

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.320
or as a print on paper.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.870
It was authenticated by
Pest Control, the handling

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.090
service that acts on
the artist's behalf

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.930
and authenticates his work.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.830
Sotheby's claims it was acquired
directly from the artist

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.960
by the unnamed
present owner the year

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.140
it was made following a show
he organized of his work

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.655
in an LA warehouse, and it
came in that gilded frame--

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:36.990
ah, the frame-- which
Sotheby's states was,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.330
quote, "chosen by
Banksy himself."

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.120
Gold frames are one of the
artist's favorite motifs.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.820
In conjunction with that
same LA warehouse show,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.070
he released a print
that clearly expresses

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.600
his dubiousness of
the auction process

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.350
and even presented it in
a ridiculous gold frame.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.500
And for his 2009 exhibition
at the Bristol museum,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.100
Banksy mixed his works in with
the museum's collection, many

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.070
of them in period appropriate
frames, helping his art

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.870
blend in, at least sort of.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.870
One of these was a gold frame
laid over a concrete slab

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.840
with one stick figure asking,
"Does anyone really take

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.870
this kind of art seriously?",
and another replying,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.019
"Never underestimate the
power of a big gold frame."

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.390
A year later, this
image appeared on a wall

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.970
in San Francisco
clearly demonstrating

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.850
the uneasy situation
Banksy has found himself

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.660
in as his profile has risen
and more and more people try

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.620
to benefit of unauthorized sales
and exhibitions of his work.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.650
Now I find it unlikely that
no one at Sotheby's knew

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.230
what was going to happen
with this big gold frame

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.090
or that anyone
inspecting it would find

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.900
nothing suspicious about it.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.560
I also find it unconvincing
that Banksy's video

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.220
showing his frame construction
was made back in 2006

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.840
or that it's
coincidental that it was

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.440
the last lot in the auction.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.070
Banksy very well could
have been the prior owner.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.830
Sotheby's doesn't have to
disclose that information.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.630
Regardless, what
happened indicates

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.720
very strongly that people
really do take this kind of art

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.620
seriously.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.360
They probably would
have even if it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.850
hadn't been in the gold
frame, but they're certainly

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.550
taking it even more seriously
now that the frame has

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.550
revealed itself to be an
integral part of the work.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.090
When he posted his video, Banksy
included the quote by Picasso,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.450
"The urge to destroy is
also a creative urge."

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.490
And Banksy certainly
isn't the first artist

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.100
to incorporate
destruction in art making.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.710
Man Ray made his first
indestructible object

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.220
in 1923, an altered
metronome that the viewer

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.440
is instructed to smash
when they've reached,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.210
quote, "the limit of endurance."

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.870
Robert Rauschenberg is famous
for his 1953 erased Willem de

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.320
Kooning drawing, and Nicki
de Saint Phalle for her 1961

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.510
exhibition in which
she asks visitors

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.170
to fire at her relief paintings
with a .22 caliber rifle.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.380
There are many ways a work of
art comes into being, be it

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.650
an additive process,
a subtractive process,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.320
one that must unfold
in space and time,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.750
or one that's
immaterial, not existing

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.630
until the moment it's
performed and then disappearing

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.830
as soon as it's over.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.840
"Girl with Balloon"
was one artwork,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.940
and now it's another
that came into being

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.850
through a public action but
which still very much has

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.420
a material presence because
the object wasn't destroyed.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.040
It's only half shredded.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840
And since it was
canvas going through,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.910
the remaining fringe
is pretty stable.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.460
I can totally see an
art packer carefully

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.680
crafting a crate that
will keep it safe

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.960
and sound until its
next exhibition.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840
It really only got more
interesting when shredded.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.840
Editioned prints, or
paintings of Banksy's images,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.690
even if sanctioned by the
artist, are all right,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.790
but they certainly don't
have the subversive power

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.450
or presence of his art made
in and for the public arena.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.730
His gilt frames had
served the purpose

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.120
of emphasizing the artificiality
of putting these images meant

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.190
for the public
into private hands,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.170
but now one of those
frames has revealed

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.960
itself to be an agent
of insurrection,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.480
however incomplete its
act of destruction.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.140
And the art world loves being
questioned and criticized.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.830
It's weird.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.590
It's almost like a kind
of high-class nagging

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.650
which they've even given their
own academic-sounding term.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.740
Institutional critique is what
they call the art that actively

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.990
critiques the
structures it lives in

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.170
and that make it possible,
like museums or galleries

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.090
or, in this case,
an auction house.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.980
It became a thing
after institutions

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.500
started to collect more
ephemeral and performative

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.350
works made by artists
in the '60s and '70s

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.510
by artists strategically
trying to avoid

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.490
the traditional spaces for art.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.480
But no matter.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.490
Museums were happy
to matriculate

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.000
these invasive works and include
them in their histories of art,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.120
and in many cases people
proved willing to buy them too.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.920
And so it's not
at all surprising

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.170
when something as
straightforwardly material

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.800
as this work by Banksy can fetch
such a high price at auction,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.390
and it's not
surprising either when

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.300
its collector is willing
to accept it's transformed

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.460
and likely even
more valuable state,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.920
especially now
that post action it

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.350
embodies some aspect
of the subversion that

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.180
makes Banksy Banksy.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.580
It can actually live more
comfortably in an exhibition

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.160
now than it could
before, hanging half

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.850
in and out of its frame, telling
its own history of Banksy's

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.850
shenanigans.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.210
But there's also another
important element of this work

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.910
that we might be overlooking,
and that's the publicity

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.830
and press that has
swirled around it,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.530
which I'd argue is as much a
part of the work as what went

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.820
down at Sotheby's.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.370
Banksy is brilliant at
attracting attention

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.180
and generating controversy.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.200
His anonymity is part of that
and something I hope never

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.280
goes away.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.020
With this work,
he draws attention

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.240
to the auction
process in general,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.110
which is followed closely only
by an extremely tiny community.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.289
Most of us see headlines about
multimillion dollar sales,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.299
feel nauseous, and then move on.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.220
The auction system
in its current form

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.220
survives in part because most
people aren't paying attention

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.820
to it.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.940
It's a highly efficient way
for the international uber-rich

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.430
to buy and trade
valuable assets.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.970
Sure, some are in the
game for good reasons,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.990
but Banksy's action
has made us all more

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.090
aware of a few key facts.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.270
People are willing to pay
ungodly sums of money for art

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.200
these days.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.530
With rare exceptions, none of
that money goes to the artists.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.600
These are secondary
sales, meaning

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.830
one owner is selling to another.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.920
Most artists are
completely powerless when

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.270
their work goes to auction.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.090
To take back some of that
power, you might have to get

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.540
your hands a little dirty, like
when Damien Hirst orchestrated

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.500
his own direct-to-auction sale
in 2008 and like this recent

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.070
stunt by Banksy, which may or
may not have been executed with

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.780
the cooperation of Sotheby's.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.570
Whether or not we assume
what Banksy says is true--

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.090
which we really shouldn't--

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.960
"Love is in the Bin"
still reminds us

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.030
of the convoluted
power structures

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.340
that vie for what
art and which artists

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.010
get anointed as
important and valuable.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.400
We like Banksy's work because
it helps us see the gross power

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.950
imbalances all around
us, even if they're

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.850
imperfect and temporary and
corruptible by outside forces,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.580
or perhaps we love them more
because of those things.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.910
Banksy may seem like less of the
pure countercultural rebel he

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.220
once was, but I,
for one, appreciate

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.780
these recent attempts at
effecting change, however

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.200
small, from the inside, or at
least with one foot in and one

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.930
foot out, able to
capture money from sales

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.510
that will happen with
or without his blessing,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.780
and perhaps apply those proceeds
to new work in the future.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.600
I, for one, will be looking
out for some very public

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.450
$1.3 million
expenditures from Banksy

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.550
in the not-too-distant future.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.980
I'll leave it to
him to surprise me.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.320
Do you want to know more
about money so you can maybe

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.580
buy a Banksy one day?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.740
