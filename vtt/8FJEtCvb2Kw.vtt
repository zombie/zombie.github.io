defines a generation it changes the
world and right now in the era of new

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.110
media created for streaming online video
that is still beginning to define its

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:27.440
own identity we can clearly pinpoint the
apotheosis of generation-defining web

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.619
series which intersects altruism
accessibility technical skill and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.700
philosophy I'm talking of course about
the YouTube series how to kick it with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.530
Yolanda Gump welcome back to how to kick
it I'm Yolanda during the course of an

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.350
episode of how to take it
Yolanda challenges herself with the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.640
creation of a novelty cake usually in
the shape of a real-life object often a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.660
tie-in with a relevant pop culture
artifact that she has obviously never

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:03.320
seen and usually draped in fondant the
most disgusting foodstuff man has yet

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.239
cruelly devised I'm going to carefully
lift up the remaining fondant hold it

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.830
and drape it over the banana a typical
how to cake in episode goes as follows

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:22.580
first Yolanda bakes her cake usually
double-digit pounds of it 21 pounds 18

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.200
pounds of cake then she soaks the cake
in simple syrup from her tool which her

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280
commenters have named sir squeeze a lot
sir squeeze her short you can buy your

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
very own sir squeeze at her website then
she begins to ice the cake before

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.310
promoting her paid service Camp cake I
hope I see you at Camp cake where you

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.970
can bake and decorate a cake with
Yolanda in real time then she carves the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.290
cake into the right shape while asking a
question for you to leave a comment

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.860
which will up engagement be more
favorable to YouTube's algorithm then

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.660
she crumb coats and chills the cake it
is time to crumb coat and chill it's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.140
time to crumb coat and chilled through
before mentioning her t-shirt club

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.880
asking for shares promoting her 2nd
channel and then removing the chilled

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.030
cake to do the final icing then she
mentions her month

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.540
sprinkle service which you can subscribe
to then she drapes her cake in the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.930
horrible horrible fondant before then
reminding you to subscribe to the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.950
channel if you have it then the
decoration begins after which she

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.459
reminds you that you can buy more of her
merchandise at her website and during

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.330
the hours of meticulous decorating she
also reminds the viewer to buy her book

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.780
a tactic which only a sucker would fall
for as of August 2018 how to cake it has

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.640
amassed 3.8 million subscribers in about
3 years and in that 3 years the show has

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.350
grown from one or two calls to action
within a given episode toe on average 11

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.800
calls to action in an episode your
average episode of how to cake it is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.850
almost more call to action that it is
cake making at this point for those of

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.350
you who are not help to the lingo or who
have never had a social media manager of

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.090
some sort a call to action is wherein
the content of a video the host asks the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.370
viewer to do engagement with the content
in a more active way than just sitting

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.720
on your ass for 11 to 17 minutes this
can be as small as asking me for you to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.500
smash that like button if you enjoyed
this video today please don't forget to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.549
give it a big thumbs up down below it's

suggesting that you use my URL to go
build your own beautiful Squarespace

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.860
website calls to action are somewhat
unique to online media if you're hosting

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
a cooking show on Food Network you can't
exactly ask someone to leave a comment

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.120
on their cable channel I mean I guess
you can but but calls to action are not

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.110
completely unique to online media one
key to the popularity of RuPaul's Drag

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.430
Race is their prevalence on social media
which is not only encouraged by a RuPaul

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.410
soliciting calls to action I want to
hear from you the fans who do you think

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.620
deserves the crown are you Team aquaria
Team Asia but by the structure of its

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.950
show lending itself to easy sharing not
today Satan

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.700
the secret to Yolanda success is not of
course the calls to action

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.600
those gradually rose as her subscriber
count' did if you look at earlier

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.230
episodes of how to take it you see that
there are very few calls to action and

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.130
most of them are requests for likes and
subscribes with subscription services

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.700
merchandise and camp cake being
gradually added through the years and

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.090
months early episodes are actually very
conventional and more in the vein of

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.930
your typical Food Network show but about
five months after the channel launched

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.090
in the flower pot of Cake episode
published on may 5th 2015 a new element

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:48.130
is introduced then I measure then I
measure this do I look tired

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.440
no sir cumference the giggle you hear is
the voice of producer Jocelyn Mercer and

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.580
her presence in the series interacting
with Yolanda from off-screen only

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:08.080
increases from here to the point where
now it's a feature of the show that's a

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.550
workout game this element proves
engaging and in the following months

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.760
there is a correlation of increased
interaction between the production crew

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.830
and the host in effect Yolanda breaks
down the facade that is production she

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.280
jokes with her producers she jokes with
her cameraman our Americans gonna get

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.580
mad at this sometimes she even jokes
with her editor who is not in the room

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.420
the series went from the occasional
fourth wall breaks to fourth wall breaks

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.550
being a part of the show's identity

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.400
Yolanda and her producers have
effectively figured out not only how to

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.540
market a curated version of her
personality but with how she interacts

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:58.160
with her crew and the interactions with
the crew make the show feel more

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.820
authentic you feel like you're just you
know in the room hanging out laughing

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.750
about this elaborate cake that looks
like a giant turkey now pop your turkey

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.520
cake in the fridge I'm don't wait too
much of this this falls into line with

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.120
the appeal of YouTube in general that it
strips away the polished facade of

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.720
television to give you something more
real you should send every rapper a

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.360
newsletter without this info just now
same word every sentence in the song

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.419
ends with the same where mm-hmm
Yolanda can get away with her eleven

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:30.200
thousand calls to action per episode not
in spite of this fourth wall breaking

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.669
format but because of it owning the fact
that a a polish production like this is

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.900
in fact a group effort this isn't just a
show you know we're just hanging out

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.600
laughing about this cake we're just
having fun

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.930
you must chill this cake thy must chill

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.600
to be clear this is not a call out how
to cake it has a clear and effective

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.220
business model and Yolanda Gump is both
an engaging personality and a talented

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.870
artist with fondant I do find the calls
to action distracting but I loyally

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.860
watch every episode of how to cake it
and yes I own her goddamn book and no I

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.360
have not attempted to make a single one
of these cakes but there is something

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.979
special innovative dare I say lucrative
in the style and format Yolanda and her

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:22.810
colleagues have devised and other
companies have begun to take notice

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.900
the medium is the message

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.260
YouTube was founded in 2005 by three
former PayPal employees Chad Hurley

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.690
Steve Chen and jawed Karim the idea for
YouTube in part was inspired by Jawad

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.320
Koreans difficulty in finding and
watching videos online of Janet Jackson

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.380
having her tip exposed by Justin
Timberlake during the Superbowl halftime

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.570
show based on a failed prior project a
video dating site called TuneIn hookup

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.790
by February of 2005 the trio had agreed
to set work on the YouTube project with

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.690
chin and Corrine taking technical duties
and Hurley taking on a managerial /

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.340
administrative role in April of 2005 the
very first video was uploaded to YouTube

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.080
a video of jawad hanging out at a zoo
both hang what these guys explain is

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.700
that they have really really really long
and no-one ever wanted for videos of

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.500
wardrobe malfunctions ever again and
that's pretty much all today so what

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.670
does YouTube offer as a medium
arguably YouTube offers anything you

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.390
want but the platform specializes in
certain niches that flourish on this

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.610
platform more than they do elsewhere
beauty blogs makeup tutorials video game

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:52.810
screamer at ers and DIY channels make up
a huge percentage of successful channels

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.500
but the forum that both originated and
flourished on the format and remains the

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.670
most popular are the slice of life
vloggers to this day the biggest

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.170
channels on the platform with the likes
of Logan Paul and PewDiePie even if they

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.710
specialize in a subcategory like video
games are in effect slice-of-life

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.420
vloggers fundamentally YouTube lifts the
barrier between the content creator and

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.020
the viewer decades prior television had
come into people's homes

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.050
and given us the likes of news anchors
and late-night talk-show hosts to

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.320
provide a friendly public figure a
personality that people find

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.850
recognizable relatable and also a bridge
to the world of celebrity but with

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.480
YouTube we strip away the artifice
indeed even in the name of the platform

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.980
the person uploading the video controls
what goes on on their channel YouTube is

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.060
the medium of authenticity one simply
records a video at

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.360
so as they please and uploads it to
their millions of subscribers no

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.620
middlemen YouTube is the response to the
demand of a younger audience hungry for

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.330
what they consider authentic and because
of this perceived authenticity audiences

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.900
give a great deal more latitude with the
sale of certain things for instance

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.820
sprinkle services and t-shirt clubs this
observation was brought to you by

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.450
Squarespace with Squarespace you can
design a beautiful website designed by

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.320
professionals that know what they're
doing not like me but even from the

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.440
beginning there are blurred lines
between slice of life daily vlogs and

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.730
authentic fiction one of the earliest
breakthrough channels was lonely girl 15

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.330
which launched in the summer of 2006 and
was for a time

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.470
female subscribe channel on YouTube
anyway so Daniel is really mad right now

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.920
and I know if he'll be allowed to come
over anymore the series initially

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.580
presented as an authentic YouTube video
diary but gained even more notoriety

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.300
when it was outed as being completely
fictional in September of the same year

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.500
it is noteworthy that the big
controversy around lonelygirl15 was the

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.120
revelation that lonelygirl15 was in fact
an actress and that her daily vlogs were

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.140
fictional and completely fabricated part
of the appeal of YouTube is its

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.250
perceived authenticity but even if there
is no network or middleman everything

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.970
that is uploaded to YouTube is
cultivated by the creator and is it fair

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.480
therefore to say that what lonely girl
15 is trying to sell you is any less

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:12.990
authentic and Logan Cole I guess what I
what I wanted to ask you was why you

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:20.020
decided to be a youtuber I didn't decide
to be a youtuber this is anyway I didn't

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.310
decide to be a youtuber just called to
you there well there wasn't no there was

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.930
there like there were no youtubers it
was 2007 there wasn't a such thing as a

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.320
youtuber so here here's a question do
you okay so like the stuff you're

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.880
supposed to do like calls to action and
do you ever do you ever consciously like

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.530
incorporate stuff like that like stuff
that's supposed to improve metrics no I

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.440
mean the things that I do to improve
metrics are like a good title and a good

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.460
thumbnail and I don't think beyond that
like that the algorithm changes to too

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.990
much for my old man self to be trying to
keep up with it but no I mean what I do

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.399
to action because I want when I want
somebody to take an action ID calls to

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:04.810
action when PBS tells me what someone on
Twitter actually like called me out on

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.250
that they were like it's weird hearing
you do a call to action it's very not

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.970
on-brand and I'm like yeah yeah you're
right you're right

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.920
yeah influencer culture yeah hey
everything about it both of those words

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:28.690
are mean nothing I I think you can see a
flash dear Hank no I ya know this this

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.630
video is gonna be sponsored by
Squarespace if they clear okay this

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.480
video where I'm highly critical of
influencer culture

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.430
I like if you're gonna influence people
to do something like yeah you know if

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.870
you're gonna have a website you might as
well use Squarespace oh that's their

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:53.800
that's their new motto don't try to be
all fancy and shit you don't know what

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:05.459
you're doing good we're really good at
this the medium is the message

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:09.790
see I forgot his first name Marshall the
medium is the message

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:22.839
Marshall McLuhan 1961
what McLuhan yeah around one Yolanda

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:27.010
Gump started using the joshing with
producers gimmick her sub started going

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.110
way way up and by mid-2016 she's well
past two million subscribers and around

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.450
this time on July 26 2016 venture
capital funded startup craftsy begin

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.680
publishing the first episode of their
own cake show sometimes you need more

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.769
than just to know how to cake it
sometimes you need um

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:52.300
about cake hey guys welcome to man about
cake craftsy was a startup service that

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.380
specialized in hobby and lifestyle
tutorials and craft education that was

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.459
launched in 2011 by a bunch of former
eBay executives one of the contributors

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:03.970
who featured in content behind this
paywall was pastry chef and sugar artist

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.350
Joshua John Russell pointer stencil
resting against her cake board to help

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.829
make sure it doesn't shift around we
begin starring in content for craft C in

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:16.870
2012 but in November of 2014 the company
raised another 50 million in BC

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.680
financing and lo and behold they got
their own fancy cake show starring

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.949
Joshua John Russell featuring
drastically improved production values

00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:29.949
and a whole new format one that seems
strangely familiar by the way the

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:35.380
milkman came today and dropped this on
my door I don't know why I find that

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:41.940
incredibly sexy it is sexy sword baby is
about to be born

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.050
okay
so if like me you're integrating a new

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.339
cake show into your cake tube diet one
that admittedly does have more polished

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:57.100
production values than your old hat it
may feel seamless at first and this sort

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.250
of thing is perfect for you to put on in
the background of whatever it is that

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.329
you're doing and not really paying
attention to but if you watch enough man

00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:09.550
about cake you start to notice something
what bird did that come out of it's like

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:21.070
a robin's egg no Robin's eggs are very
very pale our birthday it's for the

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.550
viewers
these guys are miked James who's that

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:30.850
guy that's Mike say hi Mike hello that's
a lavalier mic and named the dragon go

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.589
ahead Brandon great okay like the sound
cop from the producers on how to cake it

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:42.100
is either at the onboard mic or from
your lung does lavalier mic but I made

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.170
about cake everyone on the set has a
lavalier mic like these this is a

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:53.620
lavalier it's not it is a Thor joke and
then you start to notice other things

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.529
like their use of props probably
celebrate

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.100
that was the best thing that ever
happened to me guys I didn't notice

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:13.600
there were balloons right above me
balloons or their use of sound effects

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.570
I'm gonna kill these balloons that pop
was at it in post

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:22.339
you all fired your fires there use of
relationships within the show trim gets

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.880
cornered you better watch that night do
you see this shirt that does not say

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.100
maybe I will cut you yeah you know just
some guys joshing around just you know

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.630
being broke bros making some cake as you
do a weird and unnatural dynamic that

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.110
Russell calls out in the very first
episode of man about cake

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.740
joining me is my all-male crew which is
not weird at all that four guys would

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.770
just be hanging out talking about cake
but that's what we do and when you spend

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.870
hours watching this show as I have you
start to realize that this wasn't just a

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.410
natural dynamic between the host and the
crew that eventually got incorporated

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:59.750
into the show like in how to cake it
this was part of the pitch the banner

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.040
for their YouTube show isn't just the
hosts it's the host and these three guys

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.030
facing away from the camera you go into
their website and there are like BIOS

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.980
for each of the camera guys you know
camera guys but they don't have surnames

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.730
or any defining attributes and their
eyes are blacked out like there ain't

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.380
goddamn witness protection so it's like
this entire show was built around this

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:28.570
scaffolding of bros joshan with each
other while making a cake let's

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:40.890
that was the best thing that ever
happened to me more like man about fake

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.930
the plain breeze just like we're done

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.920
but a youtube show can't be like the
obvious way more fake genre of reality

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.330
shows it is that has to embrace this
manufactured authenticity already

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.800
pioneered by shows like how to cake it
but here's the thing how to cake it has

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.120
a really clear business model obtrusive
at this point and honestly kind of

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.680
distracting but I get it I get why the
show exists and what its business model

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.990
is and I can respect that but mad about
cake has hardly any calls to action also

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.490
on occasion they'll do like q and A's
they'll do Instagram based contests

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.810
they'll ask for comments but that's it
the vast vast majority of the man about

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.980
cake calls to action are all about
building engagement and here's the thing

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.180
mad about cakes Channel doesn't have
that many more subscribers than I do and

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.160
I know what kind of money these numbers
pull ad revenue alone cannot pay for a

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:41.940
show that looks this nice hmm
starburst and in 50 yards I still don't

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.900
really understand what their business
model is what are you trying to sell man

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:56.470
about cake

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.050
they're just gonna get a lot of footage
of me looking sad I was hoping to get it

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:07.270
from different angles but it's genuine

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.560
literary critic marie-laure Ryan states
that we are more likely to be affected

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.970
by what happens to people we know than
by the fate of strangers and youtubers

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.760
who have shared their lives with their
subscribers for several years and

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.140
hundreds or in some case thousands of
videos can feel more familiar to some

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.460
audiences than real-life acquaintances
as we see in reality shows there is a

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.960
viewer fascination with what Ryan calls
higher cognitive emotions ie shame

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.180
excitement sadness embarrassment in 2007
vlogger Chris Crocker became one of the

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.510
first youtube stars with an emotional
appeal defending pop singer Britney

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.800
Spears who was at the time going through
a variety of personal crises and being

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.570
hounded by the paparazzi and press
you're lucky she even performed for you

00:20:53.570 --> 00:21:02.090
bastard part of the viral appeal to this
video is in part that the emotions are

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.990
so extreme and sincere that they push
the viewer to a place of discomfort and

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.080
the best way to deal with that
discomfort is to make proper the target

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:18.620
of ridicule of parody but more to the
point that the emotions over-the-top

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.850
that they may be read is sincere and in
this new marketplace of YouTube

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.320
sincerity and authenticity are the
valuable commodities reality TV was

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.280
hugely popular when YouTube came onto
the scene and remains hugely popular

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.880
even in the world with YouTube but with
reality TV there is more of an

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.510
understanding that there is little real
in what the viewer is watching with the

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.050
medium of YouTube the rules that is to
say the understanding between the

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.800
creator and the viewer are a little
different the videos on your personal

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.430
channel were like I guess a little more
stream-of-consciousness II yeah cuz I

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.350
yeah just like my day of VidCon and
stuff like that whereas like I guess the

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.170
scishow and stuff is obviously like the
most scripted and I think the

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.130
interesting thing with the stuff you do
on the vlog where those channels you

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.780
have much you have a different cadence
and the way that you speak

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.370
and I've noticed this like even when I
was doing a QA I noticed myself slipping

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.210
into this like cadence that I I have
developed I didn't even realize that I

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:21.260
had developed it over the course of how
many years yeah I am I have lots of

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.910
friends who are youtubers and some of
them I'm like you sound nothing like

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.540
your YouTube self and they're like I
don't I don't hear I don't have any idea

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.330
what you're talking about it was just
like you have a different voice when

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.810
you're narrating a video it's just
different it's completely - in some but

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.340
some people sound exactly the same and
they they are they they make the same

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.850
jokes they make the same facial
expressions like nothing is different I

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.940
think usually when people meet me
they're like surprised that I'm short

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:54.530
and that I compulsively apologize what
you don't do in your videos yeah no no I

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.290
like kids because people kind of have
like even my friends are like wow you

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:03.620
just seem like such a hard-ass yeah and
in real life you are not I don't know I

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.410
don't think I am competitive in his
videos I think it's just because I'm a

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:12.100
woman and it just speaking speaking with
any kind of confidence feels aggressive

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:22.940
that's true yeah no you're not wrong the
term emotional labor comes from Arlie

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.930
Hochschild in her book the managed heart
and was her contribution to discussions

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.550
of effective and immaterial labor
according to Hawks child emotional labor

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:35.360
requires one to induce or suppress
feeling in order to sustain the outward

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.500
countenance that produces the proper
state of mind and others her research

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.100
found that in working with affect
managing one's emotions can be

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.670
physically tiring in the same way that
manual labor is and that the

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.630
commodification of emotions estranges
workers from their own feelings more

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.870
attention has been paid in recent years
to emotional labor in a context of

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.340
intimate relationship ie the idea that
romantic relationships the onus falls

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.300
more on women to manage the emotions
both of herself and us for partner but

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.330
Haas child was more interested in
emotional labor as it pertains to a

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:10.130
capitalist commodity in hostiles
analysis not only is seeming to love the

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.119
job part of the job but actually trying
to love it

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:17.809
and to enjoy the customers helps the
worker in this effort as they are not

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:21.349
simply faking it but they come to
believe and internalize what they are

00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:25.429
doing for the job critical to her
analysis is when this is done for and

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:32.659
guided by capital it's it's kind of
strategic you want someone to have a

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:36.919
reason to come back and watch your video
I think a lot of content you actually

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:41.779
end up with it being a one-off viral
video and I'm watching this because I

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:47.509
like the video like because it's a good
funny video yeah and if you don't get

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:51.409
connected to a personality then like the
chances that you're going to come back

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:56.239
for a second video is way way down so
trying to figure out how to connect with

00:24:56.239 --> 00:25:00.349
a personality without connecting your
whole life experience without sharing

00:25:00.349 --> 00:25:05.869
everything is a really tricky balance
how has your approach to selling a

00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:17.779
version of yourself changed since you
started I that super addict no it's not

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:20.899
it's just like I'm trying to come to
terms with the version of myself that I

00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:25.639
am on the Internet
I think that ultimately I think that

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:29.959
it's it's really hard to have that
version of myself not also in fact the

00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:34.129
real me and so there's the in this weird
way like where I've been held

00:25:34.129 --> 00:25:38.299
accountable to being like a better
person on the Internet I also like just

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:42.889
find that it is more comfortable for me
to be a better person in real life and

00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:48.439
to like be really thoughtful and careful
and like aware of the impacts I'm having

00:25:48.439 --> 00:25:52.369
on other people but there is no doubt
that like I am a different person on the

00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:56.629
internet than I am in real life and then
I am very careful and I don't think that

00:25:56.629 --> 00:26:00.529
there's anything inauthentic about that
I am the version of myself that I need

00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:06.559
to be for my own mental health but also
for like the impact that I'm going to

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:09.699
have on the people who are watching

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.450
every job to a certain extent requires
maintaining a certain effect but there

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.090
are a number of jobs in which
maintaining a certain effect is a

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.870
requirement of the position if you are a
cast member who works at Disneyland a

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.380
requirement of the position is to
maintain a friendly effect it is in your

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.370
job description to make the customer
feel special and to induce a feeling of

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.480
happiness now anyone who interacts with
a waitress or a Disneyland cast member

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.660
while they appreciate and expect to
receive this effect don't actually

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.250
believe that this effect is genuine all
of the time the bartender at the PF

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.250
Changs doesn't actually care about how
you never see your husband and how

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.070
YouTube comments are scary and
overwhelming and how you're pretty sure

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.860
that the guy who sends you these
novel-length screeds about how feminist

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.800
throughing society and he's going to
kill himself and you and probably 10

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.930
dozen other people is probably actually
gonna kill you someday youtubers are

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.680
selling more than a service like the
bartender or the cast member the product

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.980
that youtubers twitch streamers and
other influencers sell is almost

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:17.110
exclusively affect and this is a form of
emotional labor more and more discussion

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.740
has turned to create a burnout but most
of that has focused on consistency

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.220
maintaining a schedule little of that
discussion has focused on the emotional

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.430
burden of maintaining the effect
associated with the creator's brand

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.300
overtime little tiny micro traumas can
build up as a result of a person

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.480
behaving in a way that does not reflect
their emotional truth but more

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.710
importantly that their livelihood
depends on and on some level a part of

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.220
burnout is the desire to rebel against
this one-sided picture of yourself that

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.030
you have painted in the interest of
consistency some extreme examples of

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.690
this are high profile youtubers and
streamers letting racial slurs slip into

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.840
their speech or going on to other
people's streams to rant about how

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.560
immigrants are bad or maybe they got
drunk in public and had a run-in with

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:02.890
the police it happens I don't mean to
condone random acts of racial slurs that

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.580
occur during heated gaming moments but
rather suggest that a part of the

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.180
burnout is a result not only of
YouTube's algorithm placing priority on

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.050
creators who upload regularly and
homogeneously but also on the emotional

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.200
labor of only showing the side of
yourself that your audience wants to buy

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.590
we acknowledge that people working in
the service industry don't always do it

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.310
for the love of the game a cast member a
Disneyland probably works there in part

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.420
because they like being nice
people but we also accept that the

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.770
effect is a part of their job not
necessarily their inner lived truths but

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.220
there's very little sympathy for a
high-profile creator who isn't 100%

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.780
grateful for their platform 100% of the
time when the same basic idea for

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.020
youtubers comes up that they're
sometimes they're afraid of their fans

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.370
that maintaining an on brand effect
becomes draining and exhausting that the

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.080
expectation of constant availability can
begin to do real harm well that becomes

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.500
a breach of trust that the Creator had
with this community a part of the

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.250
platform of YouTube what some would call
influencer culture is that it's

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.280
important for creators that their
audience think they know you and that

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.540
your job depends on maintaining that
sense of accessibility and authenticity

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.990
without going crazy the premium of
authenticity is predicated on

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.830
maintaining that the effect is
convincing the challenge for creators is

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.860
to maintain the illusion for their
followers of feeling like they do know

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.480
this creator when reality they only know
the effect the construct the site of the

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.540
Creator that the Creator most likely
without they're making a good conscious

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.430
decision to do so has decided it is most
beneficial for you the audience to see

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.940
it is impossible to have a personal
connection to a giant faceless mass of

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.620
people who are in effect your customers
and when the deception becomes clear

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:43.530
fans can get angry but lucky for me I
don't have to worry about you guys

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:47.060
you're the good ones

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.120
I remember this this very brief
conversation you and I had at VidCon

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:02.690
where you you were talking about making
this video where you asked youtubers

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:07.850
kind of random trivia questions and I
was like oh man that was so sorry

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.910
I hate you know I hate that you had to
do that while you're here and you're

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:15.380
like no I actually look forward to it
like that's like my one creative outlet

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:22.250
and that kind of surprised me because I
like I so see you too anything that I

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.400
put on YouTube is just work like
sometimes it's gratifying work but at

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:34.910
the end of the day is work to me hmm
yeah no I mean like making a video is

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:39.530
not I mean I don't know what work is I
don't know what work is anymore I don't

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:46.970
know what relaxing is I don't know like
I don't I don't I really don't know I

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.360
don't know how to do it really well
like I have a hard time I sometimes have

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.980
a hard time like being like going to
just like a gathering of friends and not

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.780
you know thinking about how could my
time be better spent so I like I do have

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.880
that problem but I do really like making
YouTube videos like I love to edit video

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.650
I love to I love to be on camera I love
to write I love the whole process coming

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.450
together I love how fast it can happen i
I'm very glad that I have this than that

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:19.490
I get to do every week yeah I know in a
perfect world what would your positive

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:25.190
impact be I want people to smile and be
happy and and like think that that was a

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:32.660
fun experience one I want people to like
get excited about the universe in the

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.640
world and like how cool and weird and
like thinking critically and hard about

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:46.430
stuff more and more like I want to
foster some kind of better communication

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:53.120
and Milland am also more and more I feel
like that that that needs to happen a

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.540
lot more off of the internet than is
happening now I think that we need to

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:06.080
have more physical connection or else we
will continue to become more

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.380
lonely and we need to occupy the same
physical space as other human beings so

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.880
my hope is also that people find
community and connection that can grow

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:23.149
outside of and be larger than just the
Internet and I don't really know how I'm

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:26.630
trying to get that done right now but
it's something I think about a lot no

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.669
Wendy am I going outside like Pokemon go
it's like that except that I'm going to

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:34.940
MFI friendship yeah no no no we got a
game of eyes friendship it's like the

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.399
Starbucks app that gamma Phi's coffee
where it's like hit a star every day you

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:46.639
get coffee so maybe game if I get a star
every time you like see a person in the

00:32:46.639 --> 00:32:50.960
real save more than 10 words to them I
like it the only the only problem I have

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.470
with this idea is but it's a non-profit
we need to make money Lindsey we need to

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.100
get filthy rich

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.139
so obviously I'm coming at this
discussion both from the angle of a

00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:15.529
creator and as a viewer part of the
reason I focused on cake-decorating

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:19.490
YouTube is not only because you know
that's what I watch but because there's

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:24.080
something that happens in media where
the scenes that are supposed to be

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.539
hidden once you see them it's kind of
hard to unsee asking what Matt about

00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:33.080
cake is selling is the wrong question
Matt about cake isn't trying to sell

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.049
anything it is instead the product to be
bought which it was after that influx of

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:43.519
VC financing in 2014 and the launch of
mad about cake two years later that was

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:48.470
all made with an eye towards acquisition
which they were by NBCUniversal earlier

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:58.639
the summer rebranding craftsy as
blueprint on July 17th 2018 big

00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:01.760
corporations see the value in
authenticity even manufactured

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.460
authenticity like many about cake or
this old companies will pay a lot of

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.480
money for brands that can successfully
sell authenticity and entire newer

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.690
corporations have molded their marketing
strategy around the faith viewers have

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.260
in the authenticity of their favorite
youtuber or their favorite podcaster

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.520
companies like Casper
audible and of course Squarespace now I

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.490
hope this doesn't come across that I'm
trying to make a grand sweeping

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.450
statement about how thing bad even
though that does tend to be the most

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:34.730
effective way to get popular on YouTube
but rather thing exists and thing is a

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.620
part of a system that you may not even
be conscious of but all content is

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.870
cultivated no one can portray a fully
lived experience on this platform and to

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:49.490
paraphrase the great Dolly Parton it
takes a lot of Labor to up here this

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:57.280
authentic this video was brought to you
